The neoteric designs and proper structural parameters of spinning nozzle will change the outlet velocity and velocity distribution uniformity of spinning solution, which could affect the quality of nanofibers. Four different spinning nozzles that can be used for high-speed centrifugal spinning are proposed. The flow of spinning solution in the different rotary nozzles is simulated based on the theoretical analysis. It can be found that the curved-tube nozzle is better for high-speed centrifugal spinning comparing with the velocity distribution of spinning solution in the four different spinning nozzles. The influence degree of the structure parameters of the curved-tube nozzle on the solution outlet-velocity is explored by orthogonal test method. The result shows that the curved-tube nozzle with an inlet diameter of 10 mm, conical transition pipe length of 3 mm, nozzle outlet diameter of 0.8 mm, curvature radius of 4 mm, and central angle of curved tube of 30 degrees, can effectively enhance the outlet velocity of spinning solution. Finally, it is proved by centrifugal spinning experiment that the curved-tube nozzle after optimization can improve the morphology and quality of nanofibers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0021-8995;1097-4628;;;;;;;;;;;;;;e50832;10.1002/app.50832;;APR 2021;;;;;WOS:000637895800001;;;;;;

The majority of carbon-fibers (CFs) anodes have been prepared by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. Nevertheless, the low fiber yield and safety hazards associated with this method have raised concerns and limited the commercialization of composite CF anodes. Fiber and nanofiber processing methods such as centrifugal spinning can overcome low productivity and eliminate the use of a high voltage to produce fibers. In the present work, centrifugally spun fibers with alloying, transition metal oxides, and transition metal sulfite-based materials are presented and discussed for potential use as anode materials in LIBs and SIBs. Emphasis is given on the centrifugal spinning process and its effects on fiber formation, morphology, and structure of these nanocomposite anodes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0921-5107;1873-4944;;;;APR;2021;266;;;;;;;;115024;10.1016/j.mseb.2020.115024;;;;;;;WOS:000621174300007;;;;;;

In SnSb/PCF composite, the SnSb nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in N-doped carbon fiber matrix due to the created porous structure. The centrifugal spinning can significantly increase the production rate of the fiber composites and the as-prepared SnSb/PCF composite demonstrated small particle size with uniform distribution, mesoporous structure which can facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte and N-doped carbon matrix that is beneficial to the acceleration of the electron transfer. Consequently, SnSb@CFs-20 exhibits a promising electrochemical performance in lithium storage. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, there have been great efforts to develop high performance materials for different applications including energy storage, tissue engineering, drug delivery and aerosol filtration. The performance of these materials is greatly influenced by the material type- structure- mechanical, chemical, thermal stability and physical properties such as porosity and surface area. This review introduces the principles of centrifugal spinning with recent developments in manufacturing.

Experimental sample collections were performed on the 30, 60 and 90th postoperative days, and the analyses performed were histomorphometric, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Reducing inflammatory infiltrate in all groups and experimental periods, angiogenesis on the 30th day did not show any difference between the groups, on the 60th day, 5% polycaprolactone/beta-tricalcium phosphate(PCL/beta-TCP) was high compared to control (C), and on the 90th day, the same group reduced when compared to C and 10% PCL/beta-TCP. The fibroplasia presented oscillations in every segment- on the 30th and 60th day, there was an increase in 5% PCL/beta-TCP, which decreased by the 90th day compared to group C. 10% PCL/beta-TCP decreased compared to C on the 60th and 90th day. The percentage of the collagen area remained high in all groups and all experimental periods. Immunohistochemistry quantifications showed variations in bone metabolism suggesting new bone formation. The 5 and 10% PCL/beta-TCP scaffold were promising for the bone regeneration process because they participated in the modulation of inflammation, angiogenesis, fibroplasia, and collagenosis.;;;;Santos Jr, Arnaldo R./I-4813-2012;Santos Jr, Arnaldo R./0000-0003-0535-0088;;;;;;;;;;;;1422-6405;1422-6421;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1159/000511570;;MAR 2021;;;;;WOS:000627435000001;33691307;;;;;

This paper reports the investigation on the influence of the pullulan/PVA blend solution composition, the solvent volatility and spinneret-collector distance on the fiber's diameters produced by RJS technique. To optimize the number of required experiments for a complete evaluation, a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were applied by means of Design Expert software. The fibrous mats morphology and thermal stability were analyzed as a function of the different parameters investigated. It was found a strong dependence of the fiber diameter on the blend composition and DMSO content, which could be explained mainly by the rheological properties of the polymer solution. The Response Surface Methodology analysis shows that the complex influence of the independent variables on the fiber's diameter could be fitted by an empirical model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1229-9197;1875-0052;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s12221-021-0392-4;;MAR 2021;;;;;WOS:000624502700032;;;;;;

The core focus of the present work is to carefully evaluate the antibacterial activity of poly(ethylene oxide)-Ag composite nanofibers in the presence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) bacteria. Centrifugally spun nanofibers were obtained from poly(ethylene oxide)-Ag precursor solutions with different Ag nanoparticle loadings. The process parameters such as the spinneret rotational speed, collector-spinneret distance, and relative humidity were optimized to obtain fine fibers. The complex morphology and flexible structure of the poly(ethylene oxide)-Ag composite fibers were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Raman spectroscopy. The composite nanofibers have been proven as a strong antibacterial agent against E. coli and B. cereus due to their capacity to form superior inhibition zones. The efficiency of inhibiting bacteria by nanofibers was over 98%. The workability of the bacteria was impeded by the nanofibrous membrane as the Ag nanoparticles presented an effective chemical ability to dysfunction the bacterial structure at the nanoscale. These results demonstrate that the centrifugally spun poly(ethylene oxide)-Ag nanofibers are promising antibacterial agents for biomedical applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1042-7147;1099-1581;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1002/pat.5261;;FEB 2021;;;;;WOS:000618885700001;;;;;;

One way to produce these carbon-based structures is by subjecting an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution containing sodium chloride to centrifugal spinning under high humidity conditions. The developed polymer fibers are then subjected to a dehydration and carbonization process to promote the formation of the hybrid carbon structure. Potential applications of this material are highly dependent upon their conducting properties. In this work we analyzed the effect of the NaCl content and humidity conditions during the spinning process and ultimate thermal conductivity of the resultant hybrid graphene-fiber carbon systems. Results show an optimum NaCl added to the carbon precursor solution and spun at a high relative humidity (around 70%) promote the development of veils of graphene oxide multilayer that interconnect with produced fibers. We applied for the first time a thermographic method to determine the thermal conductivity of carbon mats. The thermal conductivity of the hybrid fibers increases as graphene multilayers veils expand between carbon fibers, to reach values up to 28 W m K-1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1388-6150;1588-2926;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10973-021-10587-8;;FEB 2021;;;;;WOS:000615559700005;;;;;;

The present study describes the fabrication of 3D fibrous scaffolds by freeze-drying of polydopamine (PDA) coated centrifugal spun gelatin fibers. We wanted to combine the mussel-inspired chemistry, Maillard reaction, and the 3D microstructural advantages of centrifugal spun fibers to develop the green fibrous scaffolds at low cost, high speed, and desired mold shape. The resultant PDA-gelatin fibers exhibited a smooth 3D microstructure with a uniform formation of PDA thin ad-layer that enhanced the mechanical properties and stability of the scaffolds, and thereby decreased the degradation rate. All scaffolds showed promising properties including good dimensional and mechanical stability under wet state, optimal porosity over 94%, and high water uptake of approximately 1500%. The results of cell culture studies, further confirmed that all scaffolds exhibited appropriate biocompatibility, cell proliferation, migration, and infiltration. Particularly, the PDA-coated scaffolds showed a significant enhancement in proliferation, migration, and infiltration of HDF-GFP(+) cells. These results show that a 3D porous fibrous scaffold with simplifying tunable density and desirable shape on a large scale can be readily prepared for different fields of tissue engineering applications.;;;;Ozcan, Mutlu/B-2862-2013;Ozcan, Mutlu/0000-0002-9623-6098;;;;;;;;;;;;0928-4931;1873-0191;;;;FEB;2021;121;;;;;;;;111849;10.1016/j.msec.2020.111849;;;;;;;WOS:000619124500001;33579483;;;;;

Among them, functional nanofibers with large surface area and high porosity have been widely studied and paid attention to. Because of the interesting properties of nanofibers, they find extensive application in filtration, wound dressings, composites, sensors, capacitors, nanogenerators, etc. Recently, a variety of nanofiber preparation methods such as melt blowing, electrospinning (e-spinning), centrifugal spinning and solution blow spinning (SBS) have been proposed. This paper includes a brief review of the fundamental principles of the preparation of nanofibers for solution jet spinning, the influence of experimental parameters, and the properties and potential applications of the solution-blown fibers.

However, electrospinning exhibits low production rate and safety hazards, which has led to the development of the novel centrifugal spinning technology to extrude phase change fibres from composite solutions. The flexible composite phase change fibres based on Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were prepared by centrifugal spinning. Moreover, carbon nanotubes acted as thermally conductive fillers to enhance the thermal conductivity of flexible composite phase change fibres. The microstructures of the fibres were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to determine the thermal properties of the fibres. The results showed that the concentrations of PEG and PVP had different influences on the diameter and smoothness of fibres, and the energy storage effect increased with the increasing PEG content. In summary, flexible composite phase change fibres based on PEG and PVP have very good application prospects for thermal insulation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0032-3861;1873-2291;;;;FEB 1;2021;214;;;;;;;;123258;10.1016/j.polymer.2020.123258;;;;;;;WOS:000609875400001;;;;;;

Subsequently, the precursor nanofibers were modified by crosslinking and oximation to obtain PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers. The results of the scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction indicates that a large number of PAO NPs are exposed on the surface of the PVA nanofibers when the content of PAN NPs exceeds 30 wt%. The PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers possess excellent adsorption kinetics and can adsorb 176.5 mg/g of uranium from uranium ion solution (12 mg/L) within 30 min, which is faster than most other chelating nanofibers.

The TiS2/PAN precursor solutions were prepared by mixing TiS2 nanoparticles (a 2-D layered structure) with PAN in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The thermal treatment of the TiS2 in the centrifugally spun PAN fibers resulted in TiO2/carbon composite fibers. The structure of TiO2 nanoparticles embedded in the carbon-fiber matrix synthesized from the TiS2 starting material may accommodate high amounts of Li ions. The TiO2/C structure may lead to increased specific capacity, improved stability, and enhanced electrochemical performance of the TiO2/C composite electrode after prolonged charge/discharge cycles.

J;Norzain, NA- Lin, WC;;;;Norzain, Norul Ashikin- Lin, Wei Chih;;;Orientated and diameter-controlled fibrous scaffolds fabricated using the centrifugal electrospinning technique for stimulating the behaviours of fibroblast cells;JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES;;;;;;;;;;;;Centrifugal electrospinning (CES) was developed by integrating the electrospinning (ES) and centrifugal spinning (CS) concepts to produce oriented and diameter-controlled fibrous scaffolds which were then applied to stimulate the behaviour of fibroblast cells. During the fabrication process, polymer concentrations, rotational speeds, operating voltages, and needle sizes were key parameters to affect the diameters of produced fibres. The mathematical model indicated that the centrifugal force with the power of 2 was the main influence in fabricating thinner fibres, followed by electrostatic force with the power of 1. The developed CES technique could fabricate fibres scaffold ranging from 210 +/- 50 nm to 2814 +/- 96 nm by only applying low operating voltages and rotation speed which were 10 kV and up to 2000 rpm, respectively. Through optimum parameter, random and aligned nanofibrous were fabricated with the diameter being distributed mainly at 200-400 nm. Aligned nanofibrous demonstrated a high degree of orientation when 88% of the nanofibrous varied at 0 degrees-10 degrees. Compared to random structure, aligned nanofibrous presented high tensile strength, which was approximately 4.35 MPa and appropriate flexibility with 73% of elongation break. Aligned nanofibrous exhibited high cell viabilities with a 2.34 absorbance rate at day 14. The fibroblast cells elongated and accelerated in the orientation of the aligned nanofibrous.

Therefore, a novel centrifugal spinning technology, which is a safe and large-scale fabrication approach, is employed to extrude flexible smart phase change fibers using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Nano-Al2O3 was employed to enhance the thermal conductivity of flexible smart PEG/PVP phase change fibers. The flexible smart PEG/PVP/Nano-Al2O3 phase change fibers have a clear cylindrical fiber shape, no cross-linking, and uniform fiber axial distribution. The interactions in flexible smart PEG/PVP/Nano-Al2O3 phase change fibers involve physical loading in PEG, PVP, and Nano-Al2O3. The flexible smart PEG/PVP/Nano-Al2O3 9.0% phase change fibers have a latent heat of 50.7 J/g at the melting point of 46.7 degrees C. The flexible fibers have ideal thermal stability and thermal cycle stability, and the shape of flexible fibers remained stable during the phase-change process.

The pristine PVP fibers were annealed and carbonized to produce flexible carbon fibers for use as binder-free anodes in lithium-ion batteries. These flexible carbon fibers were prepared by developing a novel three-step heat treatment to reduce the residual stresses in the pristine PVP precursor fibers, and to prevent fiber degradation during carbonization. The thermogravimetric analysis data showed that the annealed fibers yielded a residual mass percentage of 36.0% while the pristine PVP fibers suffered a higher mass loss and only retained 26.5% of original mass above 450 degrees C (under nitrogen). The electrochemical performance of the carbon-fiber anodes was evaluated by conducting galvanostatic charge/discharge, rate performance, and cycle voltammetry experiments. The 20, 25, and 28 wt% derived binder-free anodes delivered specific charge capacities of 205, 189, and 275 mAh g(-1), respectively, after the first cycle at a current density of 100 mA g(-1).

Zirconium acetate and sucrose were used as the zirconium source and carbon source respectively. And polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was used as the spinning aid. After pyrolysis and carbothermal reduction at 1600 V, the as-spun green fibers can be converted to homogeneous ZrC fibers composed of uniform nano-sized ZrC crystals. Moreover, it is revealed that the as-fabricated ZrC fibers can sustain superior microstructure stability at an ultra-high temperature up to 2000 V, benefiting from a limited amount of residual carbon. The reaction mechanisms and the resulted ZrC fibers were also investigated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1000-324X;;;;;DEC 20;2020;35;12;;;;;1385;1390;;10.15541/jim20200031;;;;;;;WOS:000592928500012;;;;;;

The blood vessels of the cardiovascular system are mainly fibrous, composed of collagen (Col) and elastin (El), and its inner layer consists of endothelial cells. In this work, Col and El were combined with polyurethane (PU), a biocompatible synthetic polymer, and rotary jet spinning, a new and highly productive technique, to produce fibrous scaffolds. The scaffolds produced at 18 000 rpm presented homogeneous, bead-free, and solvent-free fibers. The blend formation between PU-Col-El was identified by chemical composition analysis and enhanced the thermal stability up to 324 degrees C. The hydrophilic nature of the scaffold was revealed by its low contact angle. Cell viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with the scaffold was proven for 72 hours. The combined strategy of rotary jet spinning with a polymer blend containing Col and El was verified as an effective and promising alternative to obtain tubular scaffolds for tissue engineering on a large-scale production.;;;;Pellizzer Gabriel, Lais/M-3124-2015- Pereira Rodrigues, Isabella Caroline/H-2081-2018;Pellizzer Gabriel, Lais/0000-0003-4035-5626- Pereira Rodrigues, Isabella Caroline/0000-0003-3874-2387;;;;;;;;;;;;0160-564X;1525-1594;;;;MAY;2021;45;5;;;;;E113;E122;;10.1111/aor.13857;;DEC 2020;;;;;WOS:000597641000001;33169400;;;;;

The mixed polymer solution of PLA and PCL in dichloromethane and a cosolvent of dichloromethane and ethanol was prepared. The effect of the spinning condition such as a rotational speed (1000-5000 rpm), a ratio between PLA and PCL (80:20, 75:25 and 70:30) and a ratio between dichloromethane and ethanol (90:10 and 80:20) as a cosolvent on porosity percentage and morphology were investigated. The results demonstrated that when the PLA concentration increased, the fibers diameter increased but the porosity percentage decreased due to the low mobility of PLA. Upon increasing the rotational speed, the fibers diameter decreased because of highly developed jet, which overcomes the intermolecular forces between polymer chains and polymer-solvent interaction. When incorporating the higher concentration of PCL into PLA matrix, the specific area tended to decrease. The results also showed the different rough surface fibers prepared from cosolvent and dichloromethane, resulting from the different evaporation rate of the solvents compared with the fibers spun using only dichloromethane as a solvent. The porous structure of the fibers changed when using a cosolvent due to the phase inversion before the solvent evaporated and the different evaporation rates between dichloromethane and ethanol. The specific area increased upon adding ethanol into the polymer solution. In vitro drug release studies concluded that the higher specific area increases the efficiency of drug release and drug loading of fibers.

The polymers were melted in a heat chamber and centrifuged with a high speed to obtain the fibers with the high productivity. The viscosity of polymers was an important factor for the quality and quantity of the non-woven fiber. In this work, a commercial grade and synthesized PLA were used to prepare the non-woven fiber. The non-woven PLA fibers were produced at different temperatures of 190-230 degrees C with rotational speed between 650 and 2800 rpm. The morphology of non-woven PLA was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The effect of temperature was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The non-woven PLA had a smooth surface along the fibers. The result showed that as the temperature or rotational speed increased, the fiber diameter was decreased. The fiber diameters of PLA 3052D, L130, and synthesized PLA (at 650 rpm) decreased to 40%, 40%, and 24%, respectively, when increasing the temperature. The high temperature in the process led to generate the beads. The fiber diameter of PLA 3052D, L130, and synthesized PLA (at 190 degrees C) decreased to 66%, 23%, and 56%, respectively, with the higher rotational speed. T(onset )of TGA showed that the thermal degradation of PLA fibers was reduced compared with PLA resin, but it was still considered to be insignificant after spinning. The wettability of the samples was determined by the mean of the water evaporation. The results showed that the weight of the water in the sample decreased rapidly compared with control cotton, indicating more hydrophobic nature of the fibers obtained at the high rotational speed and temperature.

In C-spin technology, polymeric ultrafine fibers were produced by applying centrifugal force to the polymeric solution kept in reservoir provided with a narrow orifice. Once the applied centrifugal force overcomes surface tension of the polymeric solution, fibers were ejected from the orifice and collected in bottom collector. Owing to its salient features such as high production rate, highly safe to the users and controlled fiber alignment, it can overcome the limitations of currently existing techniques. In the present study, hydroxy apatite (HA) and clove extract incorporated Poly lactic acid (PLA) ultrafine fibers were produced by in-house built centrifugal spinning. The developed fibers were aligned and the average fiber diameter ranged from 900 to 1200 nm. EDX analysis confirmed the successful incorporation of HA. Incorporation of clove extract was further confirmed by FITR results. Blood compatibility assay results revealed that all mats were highly haemocompatible and showed % haemolysis below 1.

The results indicate that jet evolution processes of starch solution include steady state and Rayleigh-Taylor instability over the whole concentration range for the spinnability investigation, which are due to the hyperbranched molecular of amylopectin. As a compression, the linear molecular chain PVP solution expresses a steady state jet under the spinning concentration. The spinnability results show that the obtained starch fibers are always containing the beads due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of jet, but can be effectively controlled by solution concentration and amylose/amylopectin. Instead, the PVP fibers show a rapid decreasing of beads till to almost disappear with the increasing of solution concentration, which due to the improvement of chain entanglement increase the steady state portion of jet with the increasing of concentration.

The nanofibers were prepared using a fast-centrifugal spinning technique.

Tendon injuries lead to loss of function, disability, and a decrease in quality of life. The limited healing capacity of tendon tissue leads to scar tissue formation, which can affect mechanical strength and cause a re-tear. Tissue engineering can be the solution to achieving complete and proper healing of tendon. The developed constructs should be mechanically strong while maintaining a suitable environment for cell proliferation. In this study, a dual-phase fibrous scaffold was produced by combining fibrous mats produced by rotary jet spinning (RJS) and wet electrospinning (WES), with the intent of improving the healing capacity of the construct. Dual-phase scaffolds were formed from aligned poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers (Shell) produced by RJS and randomly oriented PCL or PCL/gelatin fibers (Core) produced by WES systems. The scaffolds mimicked i) the repair phase of tendon healing, in which randomly-oriented collagen type III is deposited by randomly-oriented WES fibers and ii) the remodeling stage, in which aligned collagen type I fibers are deposited by aligned RJS fibers.In vitrostudies showed that the presence of randomly-oriented core fibers inside the aligned PCL fiber shell of the dual-phase scaffold increased the initial attachment and viability of cells. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy analysis showed that the presence of aligned RJS fibers supported the elongation of cells through aligned fibers which improves tendon tissue healing by guiding oriented cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. Tenogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells on scaffolds was studied when supplemented with growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5). GDF-5 treatment improved the viability, collagen type III deposition and scaffold penetration of human adipose derived stem cells.

The aligned orientation of fibres and consequent improvement in the mechanical properties of the scaffold are essential in several pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, where elastic materials with high tensile resistance are required. This study aimed to develop high-speed rotary jet devices to fabricate polyvinylpyrrolidone-based homopolymer and copolymer rotary-spun fibres and establish a correlation between the operational parameters of the devices and the morphology and microstructure of the fabricated fibres. Preconstruction modelling was carried out using computer-aided design through parametric 3D body modelling of the rotary device components by assigning appropriate dimensions and tolerances, as well as material parameters. Finite-element modelling was used to analyse the mechanical stress of the designed spinnerets. The obtained fibre mats were subjected to a detailed morphological analysis using optical and scanning electron microscopy, while the microstructural changes in the fibre samples, based on the free volume changes, were analysed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy.

Specifically, we emphasize electrospinning, solution blow spinning, centrifugal spinning, and microfluidic spinning approaches. We first introduce the fundamentals of these spinning methods and then highlight the potential biomedical applications of such micro- and nanostructured fibers for drug delivery, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and sensing/biosensing.

Elevated estrogen levels during the pre-ovulation phase accelerate tissue repair, whereas reduced estrogen levels in post-menopausal women lead to slow healing. Although previous reports have shown that estrogen may potentiate healing by triggering the estrogen receptor (ER)-beta signaling pathway, its binding to ER-alpha has been associated with severe collateral effects and has therefore limited its use as a therapeutic agent. To this end, soy phytoestrogens, which preferentially bind to the ER-beta, are currently being explored as a safer therapeutic alternative to estrogen. However, the development and evaluation of phytoestrogen-based materials as local ER-beta modulators remains largely unexplored. Here, we engineered biomimetic and estrogenic nanofiber wound dressings built from soy protein isolate (SPI) and hyaluronic acid (HA) using immersion rotary jet spinning. These engineered scaffolds were shown to successfully recapitulate the native dermal architecture, while delivering an ER-beta-triggering phytoestrogen (genistein). When tested in ovariectomized mouse and ex vivo human skin tissues, HA/SPI scaffolds outperformed controls (no treatment or HA only scaffolds) towards promoting cutaneous tissue repair. These improved healing outcomes were prevented when the ER-beta pathway was genetically or chemically inhibited. Our findings suggest that estrogenic fibrous scaffolds facilitate skin repair by ER-beta activation.;;;;Ahn, Seungkuk/AAP-1105-2020;Ahn, Seungkuk/0000-0002-6850-1974;;;;;;;;;;;;0142-9612;1878-5905;;;;OCT;2020;255;;;;;;;;120149;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120149;;;;;;;WOS:000555693800005;32521331;;;;;

In this study, the flow law of spinning solution in the nozzle and the effect of spinning parameters on the morphology of nanofibers were explored. A motion model of spinning solution in the nozzle was established to study the velocity distribution of spinning solution in the nozzle, moreover, the relationship between the critical rotational speed required to form the jet and the spinning parameters was studied. It was found that the current velocity of spinning solution was mainly concentrated at the axis of the nozzle and shifted in the direction of Coriolis acceleration. The relationship between spinning parameters and the critical rotational speed was verified. The critical rotational speed for forming the spinning jet was directly proportional to the spinning solution concentration and inversely proportional to the nozzle diameter. Polyoxyethylene (PEO) nanofibers were fabricated by selectively adjusting spinning parameters and characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the diameter distribution of nanofibers could be adjusted by changing the spinning parameters, such as spinning solution concentration, rotational speed, nozzle length, nozzle diameter and collection distance.

The results revealed that formation of fibers is mainly affected by the initial polymer concentrations (and resulting viscosities) of polymeric solutions, which is in line with previous reports.

Currently, its therapy focuses on the halting of the immune response and stimulation of the regenerative processes, leading to the restoration of normal melanocyte function. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) represents a safe and cheap regenerative therapy option, as it delivers a wide spectrum of native growth factors, cytokines and other bioactive molecules. The aim of this study was to develop a simple delivery system to prolong the effects of the bioactive molecules released from platelets. The surface of electrospun and centrifugally spun poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) fibrous scaffolds was functionalized with various concentrations of platelets- the influence of the morphology of the scaffolds and the concentration of the released platelet-derived bioactive molecules on melanocytes, was then assessed. An almost two-fold increase in the amount of the released bioactive molecules was detected on the centrifugally spun vs. electrospun scaffolds, and a sustained 14-day release of the bioactive molecules was demonstrated. A strong concentration-dependent response of melanocyte to the bioactive molecules was observed- higher concentrations of bioactive molecules resulted in improved metabolic activity and proliferation of melanocytes.

In this study, we examine nanofibre properties resulting from five different electrospinning methods when using polyurethane or polyvinyl butyral. The five electrospinning methods examined were based on (a) alternating current (AC electrospinning) and (b) direct current (Rod electrospinning, Nanospider (TM) technology, Needle electrospinning, Centrifugal electrospinning). The results, based mainly on the evaluation of images from scanning electron and confocal microscopy, showed clear structural differences between the nanomaterials produced by the various methods. The fibres obtained by the AC method were predominantly fine and disordered with high porosity. In the case of DC methods, which are characterized by a significant difference in productivity, the nanofibers of an accurately defined thickness (Nanospider technology) or very oriented nanofibres with considerable surface roughness (centrifugal spinning) could be prepared. By selecting a suitable method, it should be possible to prepare required nanofibre structures (larger/smaller pore size, specific fibre diameters, etc.) for specific biological applications, sensors, filtration, cosmetic products, drug delivery systems etc. (c) 2020 The Authors.

The nanofibres were produced using the centrifugation technique, employing Forcespinning (R) equipment. The average nanofibre diameter ranged from 530 to 840 nm. The highest adsorption of gallium was achieved at pH 2.5, with a pseudo-second order kinetic model and the Freundlich equilibrium isotherm model providing the best fits of the experimental data. The thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption was spontaneous, favourable, and endothermic. The maximum capacity of the PAN/Cyanex 272 nanofibres for the recovery of gallium was 38.93 mg g(-1). In successive reuse cycles, the nanofibres showed a small decrease of the adsorption capacity for the metal after the first cycle, while the efficiency remained constant in the subsequent cycles. The desorption efficiency remained constant throughout the cycles, with values in the range 80%-90%. The findings demonstrated that PAN/Cyanex 272 nanofibres have excellent potential for use as adsorbents, providing good capacity for the recovery of gallium and satisfactory stability during reuse in several cycles.;;;;Bertuol, Daniel/AAZ-5203-2020;Bertuol, Daniel/0000-0002-4646-7816;;;;;;;;;;;;0959-3330;1479-487X;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/09593330.2020.1803991;;AUG 2020;;;;;WOS:000557596100001;32727287;;;;;

Here we produced, characterized and evaluated in vivo the bone formation of PCL/nHAp scaffolds produced by the rotary jet spinning technique. The scaffolds produced were firstly soaked into simulated body fluid for 21 days to also obtain nHAp onto PCL/nHAp scaffolds. Afterwards, the scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. For in vivo experiments, 20 male Wistar rats were used and randomly divided in 4 experimental groups (n = 5). A critical defect of 3 mm in diameter was made in the tibia of the animals, which were filled with G1 control (clot)- G2-PCL scaffold- G3-PCL/nHAp (5%) scaffold- G4-PCL/nHAp (20%) scaffold. All animals were euthanized 60 days after surgery, and the bone repair in the right tibiae were evaluated by radiographic analysis, histological analysis and histomorphometric analysis. While in the left tibias, the areas of bone repair were submitted to the flexural strength test. Radiographic and histomorphometric analyses no showed statistical difference in new bone formation between the groups, but in the three-point flexural tests, the PCL/nHAp (20%) scaffold positively influenced the flexural mode of the neoformed bone. These findings indicate that PCL/nHAp (20%) scaffold improve biomechanical properties of neoformed bone and could be used for bone medicine regenerative.;;;;Marciano, Fernanda Roberta/X-6689-2019- Lobo, Anderson Oliveira/B-2893-2011- de Vasconcellos, Luana Marotta Reis/V-6606-2019- Viana, Bartolomeu C/A-3900-2019;Marciano, Fernanda Roberta/0000-0001-7740-8766- Lobo, Anderson Oliveira/0000-0002-2544-0438- de Vasconcellos, Luana Marotta Reis/0000-0003-4344-0578- Viana, Bartolomeu C/0000-0002-5207-4269- Minhoto, Giovanna/0000-0002-9995-903X;;;;;;;;;;;;0957-4530;1573-4838;;;;JUL 27;2020;31;8;;;;;;;72;10.1007/s10856-020-06403-8;;;;;;;WOS:000552682800001;32719958;;;;;

In the present study, fibrous membranes composed of polyurethane and gelatin were fabricated by rotary jet spinning and were posteriorly characterized for their morphological, chemical composition, thermal stability, hydrophilic properties as well as cell viability. Viscosity measurements were taken to achieve the critical concentration of the polymeric solution (9% wt/v), and the production of fibers at different rotational speeds (3000, 6000, 9000 and 12,000 rpm) was performed to evaluate the effect of rotational speed on fiber diameter and morphology, as observed in scanning electron microscopy analyses. Continuous and bead-free fibers were achieved at 6000 rpm with average diameter of 12.5 mu m. Chemical composition characterization showed the characteristic peaks of both polymers and the absence of the organic solvent, while the addition of gelatin did not affect the thermal stability of the membrane (up to 314 degrees C). Additionally, the water contact angle proved the membrane hydrophilic nature (81.3 degrees). Cell viability assays exhibited cytocompatibility with endothelial cells for 24, 48 and 72 h. The results demonstrate that the PU-Gel combination with the rotary jet spinning process is promising to obtain low-cost scaffolds with interesting properties for numerous tissue engineering applications, and, thus, should be further studied.

The morphology of fibers was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), while their thermal properties by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the diameter of PLA fibers increased significantly with increasing solution concentration and decreased slightly with increasing collection distance. It can be controlled below 500 nm at the optimal process parameters which were found to be spinning solution concentration of 6 %, spinneret diameter of 0.11 mm, rotational speed of 5500 rpm and collecting distance of 15 cm. Although the crystallinity of the PLA fibers was weaker than that of the PLA pellets due to the insufficient adjustment of the molecular chain in rapid solvent evaporation and short stretching time, it can be improved by increasing the rotational speed from 4500 to 7000 rpm. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm) of the fibers were nearly keeping constant compared to the PLA pellets. Its good degradability was demonstrated by the loss of fibers structure completely within 5 hours of immersion in NaOH at pH 13.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1229-9197;1875-0052;;;;JUL;2020;21;7;;;;;1422;1429;;10.1007/s12221-020-9993-6;;;;;;;WOS:000552732800004;;;;;;

In this study, fibres were spun on a substrate by centrifugal spinning, obtaining filter media denoted 5THY and THY. Thyme essential oil was used as an antimicrobial agent. For 5THY, the thyme essential oil was added to the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution, while for THY, it was sprayed onto the medium after the fibres had been produced. The THY medium presented a higher collection efficiency, compared to the substrate or 5THY, with efficiencies of 99% for microparticles and 58% for nanoparticles.

Poly(D, L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) were used as matrices and reinforced with zinc oxide nanoparticles (n-ZnO). The morphology, mechanical, and thermal performance of the developed composites were analyzed as well as the antibacterial effect of n-ZnO. Fibrous materials with n-ZnO concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 wt. % for PDLLA and 1 and 3 wt. % for PHB were evaluated. The results showed that the incorporation of n-ZnO produces an increase in the viscosity of the precursor solutions for both polymeric systems, which caused an increase in the average fiber diameter, though the morphology was not affected, obtaining mostly long, continuous, and homogenous fibers. In addition, a decrease in thermal stability was observed to a greater extent in PDLLA systems. Regarding the mechanical performance, optimal properties were obtained at a concentration of 3 and 1 wt. % of n-ZnO for PDLLA and PHB, respectively. Antibacterial studies showed that PHB with 1 and 3 wt. % of n-ZnO effectively combat strains ofE. coliandS. aureus, presenting 100% of strain growth inhibition. In the case of PDLLA, a higher n-ZnO concentration (5 wt. %) was required to reach a strain growth inhibition above 97%. Finally, cell viability tests demonstrated that the designed fibrous mats support cell proliferation, indicating their potential for use as scaffolds in bone tissue regeneration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1042-7147;1099-1581;;;;NOV;2020;31;11;;;;;2601;2614;;10.1002/pat.4987;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000544490800001;;;;;;

XRD analysis confirmed that N-TiO2 Fs contains only anatase and rutile phases. XPS analysis revealed that N-atoms (from PVP) were successfully incorporated into the lattice of TiO2 whereas DTA and FTIR analysis confirmed that calcination at 550 degrees C for 1 h is appropriate to remove all organic impurities from the N-TiO2 Fs. SEM images showed that the N-TiO2 Fs of diameter (0.65 mu m-1.2 mu m) were produced and controlled with the amount of Ti-precursor. BET analysis confirmed that the addition of commercial TiO2 nanoparticles increased the specific surface area of the N-TiO2 Fs. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements showed that N-TiO2 Fs exhibited a stronger light absorption in the visible region and a red-shift which is responsible for narrow band gap energy owing to the presence of N-atoms in the TiO2 lattice.

M.;;;A comprehensive mathematical model for nanofibre formation in centrifugal spinning methods;JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS;;;;;;;;;;;;Motivated by our experimental observations of nanofibre formation via the centrifugal spinning process, we develop a string model to study the behaviours of a Newtonian, viscous curved jet, in a non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system including both air-drag effects and solvent evaporation for the first time. In centrifugal spinning a polymeric solution emerges from the nozzle of a spinneret rotating at high speeds around its axis of symmetry and thins as it moves away from the nozzle exit until it finally lands on the collector. Except for the Newtonian fluid assumption, our model includes the key parameters of the curved jet flow, e.g. viscous, inertial, rotational, surface tension, gravitational, mass diffusion within the jet, mass diffusion into air and aerodynamic effects, via Rossby (), Reynolds (), Weber (), Froude (), Peclet (), air Reynolds () and air Peclet () numbers, and the collector radial position (). Our results, including comparison to experiments, reveal that the aerodynamic effects must be considered to enable a correct prediction of the jet trajectory and radius. Decreasing not only renders the jet thinning much faster, but also forces the jet to wrap tighter around the rotation axis. Increasing , and leads to a longer jet. Decreasing causes the jet to wrap tighter around the spinneret but it shows trivial effects on the solvent evaporation. Changes in and do not significantly affect the jet trajectory. Finally, we propose simple relations to estimate the jet radius and the jet breakup length.;;;;Noroozi, Sooran/ABE-7125-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-1120;1469-7645;;;;JUN 10;2020;892;;;;;;;;A26;10.1017/jfm.2020.196;;;;;;;WOS:000525104200001;;;;;;

The morphology and properties of the prepared photo catalyst are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-vis), and specific surface area. The results show that the band gap of the prepared sample, g-CN-10 is 2.1 eV, is significantly lower than that of pure carbon nitride, 2.7 eV. As the amount of cotton candy increased, the absorption capacity of the prepared catalyst for visible light is significantly enhanced. In addition, the degradation efficiency of Rhodamine B (RhB) by sample g-CN-10 is 98.8 % over 2h, which is twice that value of pure carbon nitride. The enhancement of photocatalytic ability is attributed to the increase of specific surface area after the carbon doping modifies carbon nitride.

Different PCL scaffold morphologies were found to be dependent on the fabrication method used. All PCL scaffolds showed greater mammalian cell interactions. Most impressively, rotary-jet spun fibers showed that a special rough surface decreased bacteria colonization, emphasizing that no nanoparticle or antibiotic was used- maybe this effect is related with physical (scaffold) and/or biological mechanisms.

The produced mat exhibited good structural integrity and good flexibility. The developed mat was used as substrate for electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of chitosan and polyethylene glycol (PEG) along with silver nano particles (AgNPs). During the EPD process, polymeric micro spheres embedded with silver nano particles were formed and deposited on the C-Spun substrates and the size of AgNPs were found to be around 15 nm. Surface topography of all coated samples were analyzed and found that the deposition was neat and uniform. Swelling behavior of the coated substrates were studied and found that CS/HMP/AgNPs coated substrates showed 274% swelling compared to their own dry weight. Release profile of silver nanopartides confirmed that initial burst release followed by sustained release for CS/HMP/AgNPs coated substrates and this might be attributed to the hydrophilicity and high swellability of HMP. All AgNPs coated samples were completely prevent the bacterial biofilm formation and CS/HMP/AgNPs showed better reduction in bacterial growth on matured biofilm model.

Nanofibers are the latest generation of nonwoven filter media, that contribute extraordinary features. In this paper, we discuss about the conventional techniques in the nanofiber production, like electrospinning (ES), melt blowing (MB), fibrillated bicomponent fiber extrusion, phase separation, drawing, self-assembly, and template synthesis, along with its benefits and limitations. We then present the developing nanofiber production techniques, like centrifugal spinning, plasma-induced synthesis, and solution blow spinning. Here, we also investigate the developing applications of nanofiber membranes (NFMs) in separation processes like forward osmosis (FO), membrane distillation, ultrafiltration (UF), microfiltration (MF), and nanofiltration (NF). This work also highlights the surface modifications performed in the NFMs for enhancing its efficiency.

Due to its high production rate, it could provide a more technologically relevant fiber spinning technique than electrospinning. In this contribution, we examine the influence of polymer concentration and nozzle material on the centrifugal spinning process and the fiber morphology. We find that increasing the polymer concentration transforms the process from a beaded-fiber regime to a continuous-fiber regime. Furthermore, we find that not only fiber diameter is strongly concentration-dependent, but also the nozzle material plays a significant role, especially in the continuous-fiber regime. This was evaluated by the use of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and an aluminum nozzle. We discuss the influence of polymer concentration on fiber morphology and show that the choice of nozzle material has a significant influence on the fiber diameter.;;;;;Buntinx, Mieke/0000-0002-4249-0779- Reddy, Naveen/0000-0003-0163-485X- PEETERS, Roos/0000-0001-7515-802X- Deferme, Wim/0000-0002-8982-959X;;;;;;;;;;;;;2073-4360;;;;MAR;2020;12;3;;;;;;;575;10.3390/polym12030575;;;;;;;WOS:000525952000074;32150836;;;;;

However, shuttling of polysulfides deteriorates the electro-chemical performance of Li-S batteries and prevents their practical applications. Placing a conductive and porous interlayer structure between the cathode and the separator limits the shuttling effect and improves the cycling performance. Here, porous carbon microfibers are fabricated via a fast, safe and cost-effective centrifugal spinning approach and the resultant centrifugally spun porous carbon microfibers (CS-PCMFs) are evaluated for use as an interlayer in Li-S batteries. The highly porous fibrous structure is observed from SEM and TEM images, and a high initial discharge capacity of 1485 mAh g(-1) is achieved. A high reversible capacity of 615 mAh g(-1) is reached after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. In addition, the cell with CS-PCMF interlayer has low cell resistance of 25 O, whereas that of Li-S cell without interlayer is 55 O. Owing to the low cell resistance, the cell with CS-PCMF interlayer delivers the reversible capacity of around 600 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, while the cell without interlayer exhibits a lower capacity of 250 mAh g(-1). Therefore, this work provides a new approach for designing highly porous carbon microfiber interlayer for Li-S batteries with exceptional electrochemical performance.;;;;yanilmaz, meltem/AAH-4065-2020- Asiri, Abdullah M./C-3458-2009- tem, mel/ABB-2890-2020- Zhang, Xiangwu/F-1013-2011;yanilmaz, meltem/0000-0003-0562-5715- Asiri, Abdullah M./0000-0001-7905-3209- tem, mel/0000-0003-0562-5715- Zhang, Xiangwu/0000-0002-6236-6281;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-2461;1573-4803;;;;MAR;2020;55;8;;;;;3538;3548;;10.1007/s10853-019-04215-y;;;;;;;WOS:000509689700027;;;;;;

M.- Peijs, Ton;;;A study of rheological limitations in rotary jet spinning of polymer nanofibers through modeling and experimentation;JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;The recently popularized method of rotary jet spinning (RJS) or centrifugal spinning is investigated to evaluate the rheological limitations of polymer solutions and melts to optimal spinnability. The influence of Newtonian or non-Newtonian behavior of the polymer on spinnability is discussed. We observe that highly viscous polymers tend to block the die channels within a rotary jet spinneret and therefore suggest the use of relatively low Newtonian viscosities of between 1 and 10 Pa s for optimal fiber production. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used in conjunction with experimental data to establish important processing parameters, such as typical shear rates in the device and optimal polymer melt or solution viscosities. A theoretical model for RJS is compared to measured fiber diameters. The comparison shows that although fiber diameters can be estimated very roughly in the case of polymer solutions, the prediction of fiber diameter in the case of polymer melts require further modeling work.

A mathematical model of jet diameter in MDCE is established. An orthogonal experiment is carried out to explore the effects of main processing parameters on the average diameter and the diameter standard deviation of the prepared fibers. Ultimately, polypropylene (PP) nanofibers with an average diameter of 790 nm are successfully prepared in a higher flow rate of 124.26 g h(-1) than that of other methods. The X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimeter indicate that the introduction of high-voltage electrostatic field in centrifugal spinning contribute to the crystal orientation of the PP molecular chain. Therefore, tensile mechanical strength is enhanced as the increase of the loading voltage. MDCE may provide an efficient and eco-friendly method for nanofiber manufacturing in the future.

However, the practical applications of electrospinning are limited by its low productivity and potential safety hazards. Herein, a simple centrifugal spinning without the drawbacks of electrospinning was applied to fabricate polyethylene glycol-based PCM fibres with nano-SiC as a highly conductive filler, polyacrylonitrile as the supporting material, and N,N-dimethylformamide as the solvent to dissolve the polymers. Results demonstrate that the PCM fibres were formed by physical combination rather than chemical reaction. The shapes of the PCM fibres remained stable during the phase-change process. Based on differential scanning calorimetry, PAN/PEG/SiC PCM fibres containing 4.0 wt% nano-SiC melted at 51.31 degrees C with a phase-change latent heat of 69.91 J/g.

J;Liu, JJ- Wu, LL- Chen, T;;;;Liu, Jia-Jia- Wu, Li-Li- Chen, Ting;;;Investigation on the Polymer Drawing Model of the Centrifugal Spinning;RECENT PATENTS ON NANOTECHNOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;Background and Objective: Some patents have reported the centrifugal spinning method which utilizes the centrifugal force produced by a high speed rotating device to fabricate fibers from polymer melts or solutions. Recently, with the development of technologies, centrifugal spinning was employed to produce ultrafine fibers and nanofibers. In order to improve the equipment and technology of centrifugal spinning and obtain finer fibers, it is important to model the polymer drawing of the centrifugal spinning. Methods: The polymer drawing in the centrifugal spinning is modeled and simulated. The force balance equation and heat transfer balance equation are established after analyzing the motion and heat transfer of the polymer melts. These nonlinear equations are solved based on the least square method to obtain the radius of excircle and the shape of streamline. A fourth order Runge-Kutta method is utilized to obtain the diameter and temperature of the threadline because there are initial value problems of first order ordinary differential equations. Streamlines and diameter of polymer melts at different viscoelasticities and different spinning temperatures are obtained. The simulation results are compared with the measured results to verify the polymer drawing model. Results: The viscoelastic force in the centrifugal spinning changes constantly at a fixed rotation speed of the rotating spinneret. As the spinneret is rotating, the radius of excircle R-1 increases slowly when the time passes, which means the viscoelastic force decreases slowly. The change of the viscoelastic force accelerates the increase of the radius vector. The simulation results show that the threadline diameter under the condition of changing viscoelastic forces is smaller than that under the condition of fixed visoelastic forces. The temperature of the polymer melts decreases faster under the condition of changing viscoelastic forces than that under the condition of fixed visoelastic forces. The threadline diameter decreases with the increase of the rotation speed. Higher initial polymer temperatures yield smaller fiber diameters. Conclusion: The polymer drawing in the centrifugal spinning is modeled and simulated. The simulation results tally with the measured results confirming the effectiveness of the polymer drawing model. The simulation results show that the change of the viscoelastic force is favorable to the polymer drawing and both larger rotation speeds and higher initial polymer temperatures can produce finer fibers, which lays a good foundation for the computer-assisted design of the centrifugal spinning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1872-2105;2212-4020;;;;;2020;14;1;;;;;21;26;;10.2174/1872210513666190801110145;;;;;;;WOS:000529832000006;31368882;;;;;

In all cases, highly flexible membranes composed of amorphous SiO2 were obtained after calcination. This includes the first reported synthesis of SiO2 fibers by the SB technique. The structure, composition, and porosity of the as-spun and calcined fibers were characterized. The results indicated that CS afforded a more homogeneous and defect-free fibrous structure, although the average fiber diameter was found to be higher than those obtained from SB. Thus, SB provides more compact SiO2 fibrous mat which resulted in smaller pore size. The lower fiber diameter and pore size of the SB-SiO2 mats renders them more suited to filtration and separation applications, whilst the fluffier CS-SiO2 outputs would be advantageously adopted for thermal insulation applications.

PVAm has a great potential in selective separation and smart materials. It is difficult to fabricate pure PVAm nanofibers by electrospinning and rotary jet spinning (RJS) without additional polymers. In this work, rotary jet wet spinning (RJWS) was applied to fabricate molecular imprinting nanofibers (MINFs) with polyelectrolyte for the first time. Initially, optimal parameters of spinning are investigated, including coagulation bath, solution viscosity, and rotation speed. The PVAm aqueous solution is sensitive to alcohol. To demonstrate RJWS application, PVAm-based MINFs for bisphenol A (one endocrine disruptor) recognition are prepared by adding dummy template, cross-linking, and template elution. The association constant (8.6 mg/L), equilibrium time (30 min), and binding sites utilization rate (80%) of MINFs are evaluated.

This system allowed control over a variety of scaffold material properties, which enabled the fabrication of highly porous (70-95%) and water-absorbent (swelling ratio similar to 2000-6000%) HA scaffolds with soft-tissue mimetic mechanical properties (similar to 0.5-1.5 kPa). Tuning these scaffolds' properties enabled the identification of porosity (similar to 95%) as a key facilitator for rapid and in-depth cellular ingress in vitro. We then demonstrated that porous HA scaffolds accelerated granulation tissue formation, neovascularization, and reepithelialization in vivo, altogether potentiating faster wound closure and tissue repair.

Despite their versatile nature, polymeric fibers are widely underutilized due to the lack of reliable, large-scale production techniques. Upon the discovery of centrifugal spinning and, recently, pressurized gyration techniques, new research directions have emerged. Here, we report a comprehensive study detailing the optimal conditions to significantly improve the morphology, homogeneity, and yield of fibers of varying diameters. A series of polymeric fibers was created using a 21 wt.% solution of polyethylene oxide in distilled water and the fluid behavior was monitored inside a transparent reservoir using a high-speed camera. Fabrication of the fibers took less than 1 s. Using centrifugal spinning, we studied the formation of the fibers at three different rotational speeds, and for pressurized gyration, one rotational speed was studied with three different nitrogen gas pressures. Using the pressurized gyration technique at a gas pressure of 0.3 MPa, there was significant improvement in the production yield of the fibers. We found a strong correlation between the variation of pressure and the rate of the solution leaving the reservoir with the improved morphology of the fibers. The use of reduced power techniques, like centrifugal spinning and pressured gyration, to yield high-quality nonwoven nanofibers and microfibers in large quantities is important due to their use in rapidly expanding markets.

In addition, the nanofibers' properties in terms of hydrophilicity, antibacterial properties and in vitro drug release were further investigated. The results showed that the CPF drug was successfully loaded and in an amorphous state in the PLA/GE nanofibers, the surface of the nanofibers was smooth and the nanofibers' diameter became large after the drug was loaded. The thermal stability of the nanofiber was reduced while the hydrophilicity was improved.

The composite fibers were produced via centrifugal spinning and subsequent thermal processing. The fibers were prepared from a precursor solution containing PVP/iron (III) acetylacetonate/titanium (IV) butoxide/ethanol/acetic acid followed by oxidation at 200 degrees C in air and then carbonization at 550 degrees C under flowing argon. The morphology and structure of the composite fibers were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These ternary composite fiber anodes showed an improved electrochemical performance compared to the pristine TiO2/C and alpha-Fe2O3/C composite fiber electrodes.

Comparing with electrospinning, centrifugal spinning technology is a prospective method to fabricate nanofibers with high productivity. In the current study, key parameters of the centrifugal spinning system, including concentration, rotational speed, nozzle diameter and nozzle length, were studied to control fiber diameter. An empirical model was established to determine the final diameters of nanofibers via controlling various parameters of the centrifugal spinning process. The empirical model was validated via fabrication of carboxylated chitosan (CCS) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) composite nanofibers. DSC and TGA illustrated that the thermal properties of CCS/PEO nanofibers were stable, while FTIR-ATR indicated that the chemical structures of CCS and PEO were unchanged during composite fabrication. The empirical model could provide an insight into the fabrication of nanofibers with desired uniform diameters as potential biomedical materials.

In this study, porous polystyrene (PS) fibers with high hydrophobicity and superoleophilicity were directly fabricated by a centrifugal spinning method (CS). The effect of solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethylformamide (DMF) on the morphology and porous structure of the polystyrene fibers was evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments. The formation mechanism for the porous structure on the fibers was also evaluated. The oil sorption capacities of the PS fibers for silicon oil, pump oil, and vegetable oil were investigated. The highest oil sorption capacity was found in PS fibers fabricated from PS solution with a THF/DMF weight ratio of 1/3, which exhibited the highest specific surface area, pore volume, and porosity.

Scalable manufacturing of nanofibers is important for future applications. This paper provides a brief review on current research activities dealing with the synthesis of nanofibers by solution spinning methods, including electrospinning, blowspinning, centrifugal spinning, and drawspinning. Among these methods, electrospinning is the most widely studied and it allows the production of fibers with the smallest average diameters among the four technologies. Blowspinning and centrifugal spinning possess the highest productivity among the spinning techniques owing to their high efficient driving force. Drawspinning is suitable for producing ultra-long single nanofiber or nanofiber mesh, although it presents the lowest productivity among these methods. In addition, this paper describes some scalable applications of nanofibers in various areas, including filters, flexible electronics, and compressive ceramic thermal insulators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1369-7021;1873-4103;;;;SEP;2019;28;;;;;;98;113;;10.1016/j.mattod.2019.04.018;;;;;;;WOS:000484406100023;;;;;;

However, poor form stability of organic PCMs, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), is still severe. In this study, PAN/PEG composite fibers based on PEG as PCMs and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as supporting material were successfully prepared by the centrifugal spinning technique. A combination of different parameters including concentrations of PAN, rotational speed and mass ratios of PAN/PEG are investigated to optimize the spinning technique of PAN/PEG composite fibers. The fibrous morphology of the obtained composite fibers was smooth and cylindrical as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses were used to confirm that there was no chemical interaction occurred in the composite PCMs. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results show that PAN/PEG composite fibers have suitable phase change temperature but low latent heat. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) results show that PAN/PEG composite fibers exhibited excellent thermal stability. Based on the above tests and analysis, it could be confirmed that the PAN/PEG composite fibers exhibited good thermal properties and may have application prospects in mass production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2053-1591;;;;;SEP;2019;6;9;;;;;;;95502;10.1088/2053-1591/ab2d0a;;;;;;;WOS:000474203200001;;;;;;

The main purpose of this paper is to compare the properties of C/AKP composite fibers prepared by centrifugal spinning and wet spinning. The hydrogen bond type, break strength, morphology, crystallinity, and thermal stability are analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electronic single silk strength testing, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that the C/AKP composite fibers contain intramolecular hydrogen bonds (OH-OH and annular polymer bonds) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (OH-pi, OH-ether O, and OH-N). The centrifugal spinning composite fibers have a higher percentage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, a higher break strength, and higher crystallinity than the wet spinning fibers.

Researchers try to emulate these unique structures or obtain inspiration from them. In general, materials with a single structure are easy to prepare but it is difficult to achieve multiple functions or performances simultaneously. Here, a facile method with general applicability and a high yield for preparing interpenetrating-syncretic micro-nanocomposite fibers with a multilevel hierarchy structure via bicomponent electrostatic-centrifugal spinning is introduced. This 3D structure is distinctive and differs from previous micro-nanocomposite structure, in which nanofibers are embedded through microfibers. The formation of a longer, more complex and diversified path is close to undulating surface, mainly because of microfiber introduction. Those characteristics in favor of improving the capture rate of particle on the surface. Two different preparation routes are designed. By controlling the spinning parameters, samples with an outstanding filtering efficiency, a low pressure drop, a high quality factor, an optical transparency, and an excellent impact resistant are constructed. Because the different fiber diameters assume different functions, this work could be used to construct diverse materials by using suitable polymers in other fields that require different fiber sizes and a solid multilevel hierarchy structure to improve the mechanical properties and corresponding performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1438-1656;1527-2648;;;;AUG;2019;21;8;;;;;;;1801361;10.1002/adem.201801361;;;;;;;WOS:000481868900001;;;;;;

For this, Nylon 6 nanofibers were produced and modified with di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (DEHPA) for application in the solid-phase extraction of In. The best extraction conditions for concentration of In were 30% DEHPA, pH 0.5, 7.5 min contact time, and S:L ratio of 1:300. In this step, an In extraction efficiency of around 74% was obtained. In stripping steps, an efficiency of 92% was achieved using 1.5 M HCI, S:L ratio of 1:20, and 5 min contact time. Under the best extraction and stripping conditions, it was possible to obtain up to 6-fold concentration of In, compared to the initial concentration. In addition, the nanofibers were evaluated in terms of their stability and capacity for reuse, which showed that there was no significant loss of DEHPA and that the extraction efficiency remained almost constant. The findings demonstrated the possibility of using the Nylon 6/DEHPA nanofibers in a highly efficient extraction/stripping procedure for the selective recovery of In and Sn, with reduced environmental impacts.

The chemical structure of the composite fiber was characterized by FT-IF and NMR, the thermal property was characterized by DSC, and the morphology features was analyzed by SEM and EDS. The NMR result demonstrates there are chemical shifts at delta = 155.6 ppm indicating C=C has been successfully introduced via acylation, and at delta = 70.06 ppm indicating that allyloxy polyethylene glycol (APEG) has been grafted onto feather keratin (FK). The DSC results show an decline in the endothermic peak related to melting of the APEG from 54.87 degrees C to 40.1 degrees C (phase change fiber), indicating the strong interaction between sodium alginate (SA) and feather keratin-g-allyloxy polyethylene glycol (FK-g-APEG). The mechanical properties test shows that the optimal spinning temperature is 40 degrees C, and the optimal Centrifugal speed is 500 r/min. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study analyzes the effect of polymer concentration (8, 10, and 12wt %) and angular speed on the fiber morphology, diameter distribution, and fiber yield. The increase in polymer concentration and angular speed favored the formation of continuous and homogeneous submicrometer fibers with an absence of bead formation and higher output. The optimal conditions were established considering the morphological characteristics that exhibit a greater surface area (homogeneous and submicrometer fibers)- and they were achieved at a polymer concentration of 10 wt % at an angular speed ranging from 8000 to 10 000rpm. Optimization of PDLLA submicrometer fiber fabrication lays the groundwork for scaling up the process and serves as a platform to further develop promising applications of PDLLA nonwoven mats, particularly in the biomedical area such as in scaffolds for tissue engineering.

Our results also show that surfactants can provide a possibility of further manipulating of the break-up and main droplets.;;;;Alsharif, Abdullah Madhi/H-8680-2015;Alsharif, Abdullah Madhi/0000-0001-5208-5200;;;;;;;;;;;;0169-5983;1873-7005;;;;JUN;2019;51;3;;;;;;;35510;10.1088/1873-7005/ab156e;;;;;;;WOS:000470890900001;;;;;;

The produced heat resistant media was challenged with NaCl nanoparticles to investigate their filtration performance. To obtain inorganic SiO2 nanofibers, C-spun organic PVP-TEOS nanofibers were calcinated at 300-600 degrees C. Effects of solution concentration and calcination temperature on crystallinity, morphology and air filtration performance of nanofibers were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed to analyze fiber diameter and morphology of nanofibrous webs. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was realized for the thermal behavior of samples. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) analysis were realized for further characterization. In addition to the chemical and morphological analysis, the ductility of the samples was investigated via tensile tests. Finally, calcinated webs were challenged with 0.4 mu m salt particles to analyze their filtration performance. The calcinated 5 wt% TEOS/PVP silica nanofiber webs were more brittle due to three times lower precursor content. Therefore, flexibility (percent elongation) of 15 wt%TEOS/PVP sample was nearly five times higher than 5 wt%TEOS/PVP sample. The calcinated 15 wt%TEOS/PVP sample showed the highest filtration performance among all the silica nanofibers. The average fiber diameter of the optimized web was found to be the lowest, which is around 521 +/- 308 nm, which resulted in enhanced filtration efficiency around 75.89%.

The effect of the spinneret rotational speed and concentration of PAA solutions on the diameter of nanofibers and on their quality (assessed by the absence of beads) is discussed. The main physical properties of PAA such as glass-transition temperature (T-g) are studied in detail and compared to the feature of the as-received homopolymer. It is shown that the glass-transition temperature of the bulk PAA and PAA nanofibers (as measured by differential scanning calorimetry) depends on the heating rate according to a Williams-Landel-Ferry-like equation. Raman spectroscopy data provided additional information about the differences between the as-received polymer and the nanofibers. Preliminary results on antibacterial properties of the PAA nanofibers are reported. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Besides the rapid developments, fabrication of novel fibrous materials with novel techniques is still under investigation. Polyvinylepyrrolidone (PVP) is one of the multifunctional materials, which has attracted scientific interests to be employed in a variety of advanced applications. The main objective of the present study was therefore to explore the effects of essential parameters involved in fabrication of PVP nanofibers via an ECS system. The effects of rotational speed (197-4051 r/min) and applied voltage (0-14 kV) on the structural and morphological properties of nanofibers were also investigated. Analyses of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were performed with Digimizer and SPSS16.0 software to characterize the diameter distribution of the nanofibers. The degree of crystallinity was evaluated by the X-ray diffraction method. In order to explain the unexpected results, further investigations were performed on the motion of the jet and flow rate. The results showed that instead of nanofibers, microparticles were formed at lower voltages and rotational speeds. The increase in the applied voltage resulted in a decrease in the minimum rotational speed that is required to form continuous fluid jet. The bending instabilities were changed from whipping to spiraling at the voltages above 10 kV. This resulted in the minimum fiber diameter at a voltage between 6 and 10 kV. Moreover, the applied voltage slightly affected the degree of crystallinity. No significant change was observed in the degree of crystallinity by varying the rotational speed.;;;;;Valipour, Afsaneh/0000-0001-6444-0249;;;;;;;;;;;;1042-7147;1099-1581;;;;APR;2019;30;4;;;;;941;950;;10.1002/pat.4528;;;;;;;WOS:000461066000013;;;;;;

This study compared the effect of platelet-functionalization of 2D electrospun and 3D centrifugal spun scaffolds on the osteogenic potential of hMSCs. Scaffolds prepared from poly-epsilon-caprolactone, using electrospinning and centrifugal spinning technology, were functionalized using five different concentrations of platelets. Cell proliferation, metabolic activity and osteogenic differentiation were tested using hMSCs cultured in differential and non-differential medium. The porous 3D structure of the centrifugal spun fibers resulted in higher cell proliferation. Furthermore, the functionalization of the scaffolds with platelets resulted in a dose dependent increase in cell metabolic activity, proliferation and production of an osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase. The effect was further promoted by culture in an osteogenic differential medium. The increase in combination of both platelets and osteogenic media shows an improved osteoinduction by platelets in environments rich in inorganic phosphate and ascorbate. Nevertheless, the results of the study showed that the optimal concentration of platelets for induction of hMSC osteogenesis is in the range of 900-3000 x 10(9) platelets/L. The study determines the potential of electrospun and centrifugal spun fibers with adhered platelets, for use in bone tissue engineering.;;;;Lukasova, Vera/AAC-4914-2019- Sedlacek, Radek/J-3496-2012- Lukasova, Vera/O-9750-2017;Lukasova, Vera/0000-0003-0227-3347- Sedlacek, Radek/0000-0001-8468-5921- Sovkova, Vera/0000-0002-4618-9828- himawan, erico/0000-0002-1610-458X- Vocetkova, Karolina/0000-0002-5664-0109;;;;;;;;;;;;0928-4931;1873-0191;;;;APR;2019;97;;;;;;567;575;;10.1016/j.msec.2018.12.069;;;;;;;WOS:000457952800054;30678943;;;;;

Therein, the byproduct water-soluble NaCl crystal was recycled and used as the self-manufactured and self-sacrificial template. The dissolving out of NaCl for the in situ preparation of BiOCl on the surface of TiO2-delta generates rich mesoporous fiber structure. The flower-like BiOCl nanosheets provide large surface area for the adsorption of reactants, and more light scattering/reflection channels for enhancing light absorption. A series of characterizations confirmed that the introduction of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 broadens the light response to visible range, and the promotion of charge separation due to the formation of p-n junction between BiOCl and TiO2-delta. As a result, the BiOCl/TiO2-delta fiber exhibits enhanced broadband photocatalytic performance in the degradation of reactive brilliant red and colorless phenol. The apparent reaction rate constant achieved by the optimized BiOCl/ TiO2-delta composite (0.0636 min(-1)) far surpasses that of TiO2-delta fibers (0.0026 min(-1)) by a factor of 24 under visible light irradiation. The reactive species involved in photocatalysis were detected by scavenger experiments and electron spin resonance spectra. The possible charge transfer processes and mechanism were explored and discussed in detail.

It has the potential to fabricate nanofiber on a large scale because its production efficiency is much greater than traditional methods. Nozzle is an important part of high-speed centrifugal spinning equipment because its length, shape, and diameter all will affect the morphology and quality of nanofiber. It is useful to study the movement and forces of spinning solution in the nozzle. In this article, the principle and equipment structure of high-speed centrifugal spinning are briefly introduced at first. Then the movement and forces of spinning solution are analyzed by establishing parametric model at nozzle. It can be found that the spinning solution is ejected from nozzle when the rotating speed reaches a critical value. The critical rotating speed is inversely proportional to the radius of nozzle and directly proportional to the viscosity of spinning solution. There are several nozzle structures proposed and compared for nozzle optimization. Finally, the effects of nozzle parameters, concentration of spinning solution, and rotational speed on the morphology of nanofiber are verified by high-speed centrifugal spinning experiments. It lays the foundation for optimizing spinning equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1558-9250;;;;;FEB 22;2019;14;;;;;;;;;10.1177/1558925019828207;;;;;;;WOS:000459378400001;;;;;;

However, cyclic stability and rate capability of SnSb anodes are currently hindered by their large volume change during repeated cycling, which results in severe capacity fading. Herein, we introduce carbon-coated centrifugally-spun SnSb@carbon microfiber (CMF) composites as high-performance anodes for SIBs that can maintain their structural stability during repeated charge-discharge cycles. The centrifugal spinning method was performed to fabricate SnSb@CMFs due to its high speed, low cost, and large-scale fabrication features. More importantly, extra carbon coating by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been demonstrated as an effective method to improve the capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency of the SnSb@CMF anode. Electrochemical test results indicated that the as-prepared SnSb@CMF@C anode could deliver a large reversible capacity of 798 mA h.g(-1) at the 20th cycle as well as a high capacity retention of 86.8% and excellent Coulombic efficiency of 98.1% at the 100th cycle. It is, therefore, demonstrated that SnSb@CMF@C composite is a promising anode material candidate for future high-performance SIBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The mean fiber diameters of the PCL, PCL/nHAp (3%), PCL/nHAp (5%), and PCL/nHAp (20%) scaffolds were 1847 +/- 1039, 1817 +/- 1044, 1294 +/- 4274, and 845 +/- 248nm, respectively. Initially, all the scaffolds showed superhydrophobic behavior (contact angle around of 140(o)C), but decreased to 80 degrees after 30min. All the produced scaffolds were bioactive after soaking in simulated body fluid, especially PCL/nHAp (20%). The crystallinity of the PCL scaffolds decreased progressively from 46 to 21% after incorporation of 20% nHAp. In vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity were investigated, as well as the mats' ability to reduce bacteria biofilm formation. In vitro cellular differentiation was evaluated by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodule formation. Overall, we identified the total ideal amount of nHAp to incorporate in PCL mats, which did not show in vitro or in vivo cytotoxicity and promoted lamellar bone formation independently of the amounts of nHAp. The scaffolds with nHAp showed reduced bacterial proliferation. Alizarin red staining was higher in materials associated with nHAp than in those without nHAp. Overall, this study demonstrates that PCL with nHAp prepared by RJS merits further evaluation for orthopedic applications.

Effects of the rotation speed and initial air velocity on the diameter and radius vector of the threadline are investigated. Results: The air velocity is found to decrease with the increase of the distance away from the nozzle exit.

One of the ways is through the use of polymeric biomaterials such as poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA). PLLA is a recognized material in tissue engineering due to its characteristics as biocompatibility and bioresorbability. In this work PLLA fibrous membranes were produced by a simple technique known as rotary jet spinning. The rotary jet spinning consists of fibrous membranes production, with fibers of scale nano/micrometric, from a polymeric solution through the centrifugal force generated by the equipment. The membranes formed were subjected to preliminary in vitro assays to verify the cytotoxicity of the membranes made in contact with the cells. Direct cytotoxicity assays were performed through the MTT, AlamarBlue (R) and Live/Dead (R) tests, with fibroblastic and osteoblastic cells. The results obtained in this study showed that PLLA membranes produced by rotary jet spinning showed promising results in the 24-hours contact period of the cells with the PLLA fibrous membranes.

Here we demonstrate scalable production of microfibrous gelatin that supports cultured adherent muscle cells derived from cow and rabbit. As gelatin is a natural component of meat, resulting from collagen denaturation during processing and cooking, our extruded gelatin microfibers recapitulated structural and biochemical features of natural muscle tissues. Using immersion rotary jet spinning, a dry-jet wet-spinning process, we produced gelatin fibers at high rates (similar to 100g/h, dry weight) and, depending on process conditions, we tuned fiber diameters between similar to 1.3 +/- 0.1 mu m (mean +/- SEM) and 8.7 +/- 1.4 mu m (mean +/- SEM), which are comparable to natural collagen fibers. To inhibit fiber degradation during cell culture, we crosslinked them either chemically or by co-spinning gelatin with a microbial crosslinking enzyme. To produce meat analogs, we cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells and rabbit skeletal muscle myoblasts in gelatin fiber scaffolds, then used immunohistochemical staining to verify that both cell types attached to gelatin fibers and proliferated in scaffold volumes. Short-length gelatin fibers promoted cell aggregation, whereas long fibers promoted aligned muscle tissue formation. Histology, scanning electron microscopy, and mechanical testing demonstrated that cultured muscle lacked the mature contractile architecture observed in natural muscle but recapitulated some of the structural and mechanical features measured in meat products.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2396-8370;;;;;2019;3;1;;;;;;;20;10.1038/s41538-019-0054-8;;;;;;;WOS:000618966900020;31646181;;;;;

However, cell-based therapies are limited because poor local cell engraftment. Here, we present a polylactic acid (PLA) scaffold to support mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) delivery in stroke. We isolated bone marrow MSCs from adult C57/B16 mice, cultured them on PLA polymeric rough microfibrous (PRM) scaffolds obtained by rotary jet spinning, and transplanted over the brains of adult C57/B16 mice, carrying thermocoagulation-induced cortical stroke. No inflammatory response to PRM was found. MSCs transplantation significantly reduced the area of the lesion and PRM delivery increased MSCs retention at the injury site. In addition, PRM upregulated alpha 6-integrin and CXCL12 production, which may be the cause for greater cell retention at the lesion site and may provide additional benefit to MSCs transplantation procedures. We conclude that PRM scaffolds offer a promising new system to deliver stem cells to injured areas of the brain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;;;;Grinet, Marco Antonio V.

The obtained fibres were treated by acetic acid/glutaraldehyde solution (1/1, v/v) for 12 h at 40 degrees C, in order to remove residual sodium hydroxide in fibres and improve the water stability. The morphology, chemical structures, and mechanical properties of obtained fibres were investigated. In-vitro drug release tests revealed that more than 75% of loaded drugs could be released from fibrous membranes without initial burst release (>80% in the first 2 h). The ibu-loaded fibrous membranes showed a sustained release period as long as 24 h, while the ket-loaded fibrous membranes could release more than 48 h.

This study evaluates the ability of the composites to function as scaffolds for cell growth while maintaining an antibacterial activity. Materials and Methods: Two sets of chitosan fiber composites were prepared, one filled with anti-microbial silver nanoparticles and another one with cinnamaldeyhde. Chitosan powder was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid and dichloromethane followed by addition of the fillers. The fiber output was optimized by configuring the polymer weight concentration (7, 8, and 9 w/w% chitosan) and applied angular velocity (6000-9000 RPM) within the spinning process. Results: Scanning electron microscopy revealed fiber diameters ranging from 800-1500 nm. Cinnamaldehyde and silver nanoparticles helped to improve and control the anti-bacterial activity. Through a verified cell counting method and disk diffusion method, it was proven that the chitosan based composite fibers possess an enhanced anti-bacterial/microbial activity against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Both composite systems showed anti-bacterial activity, inhibition zones fluctuating between 5 to 10 mm were observed depending on the size of the fiber mat and no bacteria was found within the mats. The developed fiber scaffolds were found to be noncytotoxic serving as effective three-dimensional substrates for cell adhesion and viability. Conclusion: These results provide potential to use these scaffolds in wound healing and tissue regeneration applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2322-3049;2322-5904;;;;WIN;2018;5;1;;;;;6;14;;10.22038/nmj.2018.05.002;;;;;;;WOS:000430258000002;;;;;;

With this motivation, the production of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds as synthetic, biomimetic biomaterials was investigated, with a specific focus on potential orthopedic translation. PCL scaffolds were produced through three different fabrication techniques: electrospinning (ES), rotary jet spinning (RJS), and airbrush (AB). ES and RJS were observed to produce microfibrillar scaffolds, while all AB products were nanofibrous. Osteoblast viability, within the PCL scaffolds, and the osteogenic phenotype were assessed in vitro through a combination of adherence, metabolic activity, proliferation, gene expression, alkaline phosphatase bioactivity, and calcium deposition assays. While the polymeric scaffolds induced slight reductions in initial osteoblast adhesion and metabolic activity, seeded cells were able to proliferate and demonstrate the bone formation phenotype. AB products demonstrated reduced bacterial surface colonization when inoculated with both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial strains, in comparison to the microfibrous ES and RJS products, without any small-molecule antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, or reactive nanomaterials included during scaffold synthesis.;;;;- Lobo, Anderson Oliveira/B-2893-2011;Machado Paula, Mirian Michelle/0000-0002-0534-4596- Lobo, Anderson Oliveira/0000-0002-2544-0438- Webster, Thomas/0000-0002-2028-5969- Ghannadian, Paria/0000-0003-0577-7006;;;;;;;;;;;;2576-6422;;;;;NOV 19;2018;1;5;;;;;1566;1578;;10.1021/acsabm.8b00453;;;;;;;WOS:000616365700039;;;;;;
J;Liu, QH- Parker, KK;;;;Liu, Qihan- Parker, Kevin Kit;;;A viscoelastic beam theory of polymer jets with application to rotary jet spinning;EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS;;;;;;;;;;;;Complex deformation of a polymer jet appears in many manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing, electrospinning, blow spinning, and rotary jet spinning. In these applications, a polymer melt or solution is first extruded through an orifice and forms a jet. The polymer jet is then dynamically deformed until the polymer solidifies. The final product is strongly affected by the deformation of the polymer jet. And the deformation is strongly affected by the viscoelasticity of the polymer. Here we develop a beam theory to incorporate both the nonlinear viscoelasticity and the bending/twisting stiffness of a polymer jet. As a demonstration, we study the formation of a polymer fiber under strong centrifugal force, a fiber manufacturing process known as rotary jet spinning.

The morphological, thermal, and surface wettability properties are then evaluated. Biological properties, including cytotoxicity, fibroblast cell adhesion, and the overall bioactive effect, are also investigated. It is demonstrated that the thermal behavior is affected by the presence of MWCNT-GO, as well as the crystallinity. The addition of MWCNT-GO, even in small amounts, reduces the wettability property of the fibers, making them more hydrophobic. However, biological tests with these fibers show no cytotoxic effect in all fiber sample groups, even when MWCNT-GO concentration is increased. Therefore, nano-structured, porous, and biocompatible polymeric scaffolds are obtained, with a high surface area and with notable potential for tissue engineering applications.;;;;Grinet, Marco Antonio V.

Sodium chloride (NaCl) was added to the PAN-dimethylformamide solution to decrease the surface tension and consequently promote a decrease in fiber diameter while increasing the fiber output. The fiber preparation process involved the centrifugal spinning of the PAN-based solution- developed fibers were stabilized in air at 240 degrees C followed by carbonization at 800 degrees C under a Nitrogen atmosphere. The addition of sodium chloride to the PAN solution led to a 37% decrease in the carbon fiber diameter. The carbon fibers were analyzed by scanning electron microcopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical experiments. The TEM results revealed improved graphitization with the addition of sodium chloride. The XPS analysis showed increased functionality (e.g. O-2) on the surface of carbon fibers obtained from PAN/NaCl precursor fibers. A significant improvement was achieved in the electrochemical performance of carbon fibers made from PAN/NaCl precursor fibers compared to those made from pure PAN precursor fibers. POLYM. ENG.

The nanofibers showed similar production rates of 3.5 g h(-1). The diameters of the nanofibers ranged from 100 to 800 nm. Under the experimental conditions tested, chromium(VI) adsorption was favored at pH 3 (chitosan/nylon 6 nanofibers) and pH 2 (tannin/nylon 6 nanofibers), at a temperature of 328 K. The most suitable models for description of the kinetic data were the pseudo-second order model (chitosan/nylon 6 nanofibers) and the Elovich model (tannin/nylon 6 nanofibers). For both nanofibers, the equilibrium isotherms could be fitted by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacities were 23.9 and 62.7 mg g(-1) for the chitosan/nylon 6 and tannin/nylon 6 nanofibers, respectively.

As a new material, it has wide application value in aerospace, medicine and chemical industry. Because of its unique and excellent properties, it has received great interest and extensive attention from researchers in many countries in recent years. A novel nanofibers preparation methodcentrifugal spinning, was studied in this paper based on the study of traditional method of preparing nanofibers. The process and principle of this method were also studied. This article first introduces some traditional methods of preparing nanofibers, then describes the centrifugal spinning method and compares these traditional methods with this new method. Secondly, the entire process of the centrifugal spinning method was studied. The various forces acting on the jet were analyzed during the process. The mathematical model of the process of preparing nanofibers by centrifugal spinning was established. The simulation and experiment of centrifugal spinning method were carried out and the results were analyzed. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that the fiber diameter will change with the change of the rotating speed and the spinning solution concentration. Finally, some factors affecting the morphology and diameter of nanofibers were studied to determine the most suitable parameters for preparing nanofibers by centrifugal spinning. It can be drawn from this article that the fiber diameter is closely related to the rotating speed of the spinneret, spinning solution viscosity and the collection distance and these factors have great influence on fiber diameter and morphology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1678-5878;1806-3691;;;;OCT;2018;40;10;;;;;;;488;10.1007/s40430-018-1407-y;;;;;;;WOS:000445193600003;;;;;;

However, the alginate content in electrospun alginate/PEO composite fibers is limited to 85 wt%. PEO is proven to be inoperative and dispensable in cell culture experiments, because it keeps cells from attaching to the surrounding area before it is released from fibrous mats. Here, alginate ultrafine fibers are fabricated by centrifugal spinning in which alginate content is dramatically increased to 97.5 wt%. We investigate the correlation between centrifugal spinnability and alginate solution properties together with processing parameters, specifically including alginate/PEO mass ratios, PEO molecular weights, surfactant mass ratios and heater temperature. Results show that the solvent evaporation rate is a critical factor that regulates the centrifugal spinnability of aqueous alginate/PEO system. The role of PEO is to form hydrogen bonds to alginate, and thus to weaken the interactions between alginate and water. In view of the biocompatibility and biodegradability of alginate, the alginate-riched ultrafine fibers fabricated in this article may be in favor of applications in tissue engineering. POLYM. ENG.

While existing elastomer-based devices have attracted attention due to their compliant structures, there is a need for materials that combine flexibility, controllable actuation, and robustness. This paper bridges this capability gap by introducing a novel fabrication strategy for nanofiber-reinforced soft micro-actuators. The design and manufacturing of composite PDMS/nanofiber actuators using soft lithography and rotary jet spinning is described. We examine the impact of lamina design and fiber orientation on actuator curvature, mechanical properties, and pressurization range. Composite actuators displayed a 25.8% higher maximum pressure than pure PDMS devices.

The centrifugal spinning method (centrifugal spinning, rotary jet spinning and force spinning) is a method of manufacturing nanofibers by rotating a disc. Centrifugal spinning is a system for making cotton candy with sugar and involves spinning a polymer melt or solution at a high centrifugal force to form nanofibers. Compared with electrospinning, it shows advantages of a higher production rate and insensitive dielectric constant of materials. The factors affecting nanofiber formation in centrifugal spinning are largely influenced by intrinsic properties (viscosity, concentration, and solvent type) and operating conditions (spinning speed and distance between the tip and collector). We used poly(vinyl alcohol) to investigate factors affecting nanofiber formation, and studied the morphology of nanofibers collected at the collector and the positions where the nanofibers were formed according to changes in various factors.

However, the rapid capacity decay of SnSb anodes caused by volume changes during repeated cycles must be solved before they can be used in practical batteries. Here, we introduce centrifugally-spun SnSb@rGO@CMF composite anode for sodium-ion batteries, which not only has high sodium storage capability but also maintains its structural integrity after repetitive cycles. SnSb@rGO@CMF composite was prepared by high-speed and cost-effective centrifugal spinning and subsequent heat treatment processes. Electrochemical performance results demonstrated that SnSb@rGO@CMF composite anode had excellent initial reversible capacity (350.3 mAh g(-1) ), outstanding initial Coulombic efficiency (68.2%), and superior capacity retention (91.1%) over 200 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). Therefore, centrifugally-spun SnSb@rGO@CMF composite has great application prospect as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The most suitable process parameters were chosen by optimization of the rotational speed, nozzle diameter and spinneret-to-collector distance using different blend ratios of the two polymers at different total polymer concentrations. The basic characteristics of polymer solutions were enlightened by their viscosity and surface tension. The morphology of the fibers produced was characterized by SEM, while their thermal properties by DSC and TG analysis. Multiply regression was used to determine the parameters that have higher impact on the fiber diameter. It was possible to obtain thermally stable lignin/polyurethane nanofibers with diameters below 500 nm. From the aspect of spinnability, 1:1 lignin/TPU contents were shown to be more feasible.

Among various spinning parameters such as rpm, viscosity, humidity, chamber temperature etc., effect of rpm and viscosity on quality of spun fibres was examined in order to spin less defective (less shots) fibres. From the rpm vs viscosity experiments, it was concluded that viscosity between 13 and 42Pa.s with 3000 rpm was favourable for obtaining fibres containing less shots. It was shown that besides viscosity, refractive index and percent weight loss of the aged sol can be used as indicator for determining spinnability of alumina precursor sols. Influence of only preheating and continuous heating of the chamber during spinning were also investigated and it was found that only preheating did not help in producing fibres. Besides this, influence of hot air blower (HAB) aligned in different directions with respect to the spinnerette, on fibre quality was tested.

Consequently, biomaterials that attempt to recapitulate the biophysical and biochemical properties of fetal skin have emerged as promising pro-regenerative strategies. The extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin (Fn) in particular is believed to play a crucial role in directing this regenerative phenotype. Accordingly, Fn has been implicated in numerous wound healing studies, yet remains untested in its fibrillar conformation as found in fetal skin. Here, we show that high extensional (similar to 1.2 x 10(5) s(-1)) and shear (similar to 3 x 10(5) s(-1)) strain rates in rotary jet spinning (RJS) can drive high throughput Fn fibrillogenesis (similar to 10 mL/min), thus producing nanofiber scaffolds that are used to effectively enhance wound healing. When tested on a full-thickness wound mouse model, Fn nanofiber dressings not only accelerated wound closure, but also significantly improved tissue restoration, recovering dermal and epidermal structures as well as skin appendages and adipose tissue.

The nanofiber bundles are drawn in hot air with a constant force into 1 and 3 times of the original length. Subsequently, the crystalline structure, orientation, morphology, diameter of PAN nanofibers before and after drawing treatment were characterized by WAXD and SEM. The results show that: (1) the efficiency of centrifugal-electrospinning is far higher (120 times) than that of electrospinning (fluid flow rate of centrifugal-electrospinning: 2 mL/min, fluid flow rate of electrospinning: 1 mL/h). (2) Despite a low crystallinity from centrifugal spinning or electrospinning (the crystallinity of the PAN nanofiber precursor by centrifugal spinning is 25%, while that by electrospinning is 10.6%). PAN precursor nanofibers prepared by centrifugal spinning have certain orientation (60.5%)- while those prepared by electrospinning have almost no orientation- (3) Hot-air-drawing with a constant force (1.00 N) contributes to a higher crystallinity (centrifugal spinning: 45.8%, electrospinning: 36.2%) and orientation (centrifugal spinning: 72.5%, electrospinning: 59.8%) for the PAN nanofibers. Moreover, increased drawing temperature and force results in a decrease in the diameter of the PAN nanofiber bundles (the diameter of PAN nanofibers prepared by centrifugal spinning decreases from 675 nm to 510 nm- while that by electrospinning decreases from 460 nm to 355 nm). Compared with the slight effect of the spinning process on crystalline structure and orientation, the hot-air drawing treatment significantly promotes the crystalline and orientation. The centrifugal force is helpful to eliminate the whip phenomenon and to make a full drawing of jet flow, finally leading to a higher certain orientation for the polymer chains of PAN nanofibers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1000-3304;;;;JUN;2018;;6;;;;;755;764;;10.11777/j.issn1000-3304.2017.17226;;;;;;;WOS:000439430300012;;;;;;

In the present study, rPET fibers, with fiber diameters ranging from submicron to micrometer in scale, were fabricated by spinning a solution of rPET in a mixture of dichloromethane and trifluoroacetic acid. The influence of the polymer solution concentration (the viscosity), the rotational speed of the spinneret, and the inner diameter of the needles on the formation and morphology and mechanical properties of the fibers were examined through scanning electron microscopy and using a tensile testing machine. The thermal behaviors of fibrous mats with various average diameters were also investigated through differential scanning calorimetry. The smoothest and smallest fibers, with an average diameter of 619 nm, were generated using an rPET solution of 10 wt % under a rotation speed of 15,000 rpm using needles having an inner diameter of 160 m. The fibrous mats have an average tensile strength and modulus of 4.3 MPa and 34.4 MPa, respectively.

Rotary jet spinning is a relatively new technique for making nanofibres from both polymer solutions and melt. With electrospinning being by far the most widespread processing method for polymer nanofibres, we performed a direct comparison of polyamide 6 (PA6) nanofibre production between these two methods. It was found that electrospinning produced slightly smaller-diameter fibres, which scaled with a decrease in solution viscosity. In comparison, rotary jet spun fibres could be produced from a reduced range of polymer concentrations and exhibited therefore slightly larger diameters with greater variation. Crystallinity of the fibres was also compared between the two techniques and the bulk polymer, which showed a decrease in crystallinity compared to bulk PA6.;;;;Peijs, Ton/A-7309-2010- Rogalski, James/M-5263-2014;Peijs, Ton/0000-0002-6686-6005- Rogalski, James/0000-0001-9928-969X;;;;;;;;;;;;2079-6439;;;;;JUN;2018;6;2;;;;;;;37;10.3390/fib6020037;;;;;;;WOS:000436551800020;;;;;;

More recently, soy protein has received attention for a variety of its potential health benefits, including enhanced skin regeneration. It has been reported that soy protein possesses bioactive molecules similar to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and estrogen. In wound healing, oral and topical soy has been heralded as a safe and cost-effective alternative to animal protein and endogenous estrogen. However, engineering soy protein-based fibrous dressings, while recapitulating ECM microenvironment and maintaining a moist environment, remains a challenge. Here, the development of an entirely plant-based nanofibrous dressing comprised of cellulose acetate (CA) and soy protein hydrolysate (SPH) using rotary jet spinning is described. The spun nanofibers successfully mimic physicochemical properties of the native skin ECM and exhibit a high water retaining capability. In vitro, CA/SPH nanofibers promote fibroblast proliferation, migration, infiltration, and integrin 1 expression. In vivo, CA/SPH scaffolds accelerate re-epithelialization and epidermal thinning as well as reduce scar formation and collagen anisotropy in a similar fashion to other fibrous scaffolds, but without the use of animal proteins or synthetic polymers.

The stability and spinnability of a melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin solution were improved as expected by adding various modifier combinations. Considering the storage stability of solutions characterized by visual inspection, turbidity tests, and viscosity measurements and combined with the fiber morphology, the optimal modifier combination was obtained. The spun fibers manifested a good morphology and thermal stability as measured by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Moreover, microfibers prepared by three spinning methods (centrifugal spinning, electrospinning, and centrifugal electrostatic spinning) were compared to choose the suitable spinning method for different fields in the future. This work provides systematic and scientific guidance on the synthesis of MF resin solutions and rapid mass production of melamine microfibers and also demonstrates that centrifugal spinning of melamine microfiber is a promising candidate for flame retardance and CO2 adsorption at elevated temperature.

The previous preparations of nanofiber have some problems that scientists hope to solve. There are many ways to fabricate nanofiber, but a new method named centrifugal spinning is a better method. The centrifugal spinning uses centrifugal force to produce nanofiber. This way is a more appropriate efficient method to produce nanofiber because the production efficiency of the centrifugal spinning is higher than that of other methods. Therefore, it is also fitter for commercial production with no need for high voltage. The centrifugal spinning has overcome many disadvantages of previous methods. This paper introduces the equipment of centrifugal spinning and compares the centrifugal spinning with other methods. Then this paper describes the principle of centrifugal spinning and analyzes the forces of the material. According to the process of centrifugal spinning, this paper establishes a parametric model to better illustrate the approach. Besides, the factors affecting the diameter and morphology of nanofiber are also analyzed. The results show that there are many factors affecting the nanofiber morphology, such as the viscosity, concentration, rotating speed and the distance of the collecting device. The basic experimental platform was constructed and the preliminary centrifugal spinning experiment was carried out.;;;;;xu, qiao/0000-0002-4635-4782;;;;;;;;;;;;1678-5878;1806-3691;;;;APR;2018;40;4;;;;;;;186;10.1007/s40430-018-1131-7;;;;;;;WOS:000430239300044;;;;;;

In the present work, MgO precursor fibers were fabricated by the centrifugal-spinning combined with sol-gel method. The thermal decomposition and crystallization process of the ceramic fibers were fully characterized. Different atmosphere preheat treatment results suggested that water vapor promoted the thermal decomposition and crystallization of precursor fibers at a lower temperature. Three kinds of particles, including round particles, polyhedron particles to plate particles in the microstructure of the fibers could be manipulated by adjusting the water vapor preheat treatment. The change in textural properties (BET surface area, pore size and pore volume) of the MgO fibers, heated at different temperatures in air after pre-heated treatment in water vapor, was analyzed. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of the microstructures of the fibers were also presented.

The effects of hot blast temperature, amylopectin, and amylose on fiber surface morphologies are investigated. Scanning electron microscopy is used to characterize the morphology of the prepared fibers. The results show that fibers with burr-shaped nanostructures on the surface can be fabricated by adding amylopectin to starches and are promoted by increasing the hot blast temperature. However, amylose in starches plays the role of smoothing the fiber surfaces. X-ray diffraction reveals that the fibers are amorphous. Through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, it was found that some physicochemical changes occur during centrifugal spinning. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Therefore, carbon nanofibers are candidate to replace many commercial products. In general carbon nanofibers are produced from precursor fiber. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is usually used as precursor fiber because of comparatively high carbon yield and a thermally stable and highly oriented molecular structure. Large number of scientific publications have been demonstrated with the help of progress in nanofiber production methods, such electrospinning, centrifugal-spinning, air blowing from melt or solution, and optimization of process parameters of those methods. In this study, PAN nanoyarn is first obtained by the electrospnning method which is very convenient process for producing thin fiber. Stabilization is then applied by exposure to air at 230 degrees C to provide thermally stable structure so that the resulting PAN nanofibers could be thermally durable during the carbonization process at high temperature. Finally, the process for the carbonization of the stabilized sample is operated in a argon gas atmosphere at 600 degrees C.

The distance from the nozzle to the collector was set at 10-90 cm. Thermal images informed the accumulation of PP fibers flows at shorter collector distance. The diameters of PP micro-fibers decreased with increasing the air pressures and the nozzle temperatures.

Centrifugal spinning is a comparatively new method of producing fibers having nano- or microscale diameters. In this study, three main parameters (nozzle orifice diameter, rotational speed, polymer concentration) of centrifugal spinning were optimized to produce air filter media from thermoplastic polyurethane nanofibers.

A liquid jet undergoing electric and centrifugal forces, as well as other forces, first travels in a stable trajectory and then goes through an unstable curled path to the collector. In numerical modeling, hydrodynamic equations have been solved using the perturbation method-and the boundary integral method has been implemented to efficiently solve the electric potential equation. Hydrodynamic equations have been coupled with the electric field using stress boundary conditions at the fluid-fluid interface. Perturbation equations were discretized by a second order finite difference method, and the Newton method was implemented to solve the discretized non-linear system. Also, the boundary element method was utilized to solve electrostatic equations. In the theoretical study, the fluid was described as a leaky dielectric with charges only on the surface of the jet traveling in dielectric air. The effect of the electric field induced around the nozzle tip on the jet instability and trajectory deviation was also experimentally studied through plate-plate geometry as well as point-plate geometry. It was numerically found that the centrifugal force prevails on electric force by increasing the rotational speed. Therefore, the alteration of the applied voltage does not significantly affect the jet thinning profile or the jet trajectory.

The electrospinning technique has attracted great interest among academic and industrial scientists because it is a very simple and effective approach to produce nanofibers, which are attractive for various applications in biomedical engineering, filtration, protective clothing, catalysis reactions, and sensors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the morphological differences between the aligned poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers obtained using the centrifugal jet spinning and modified electrospinning methods. The morphological changes were observed in detail by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The dependence of the nanofiber alignment on the applied voltage or rotational velocity during fabrication was investigated. Changes in these two parameters caused gradual changes in the nanofiber alignment and alterations in the morphology of the nanofibers.;;;;Yang, Seong Baek/AAP-1745-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;1533-4880;1533-4899;;;;DEC;2017;17;12;;;;;9056;9062;;10.1166/jnn.2017.14369;;;;;;;WOS:000417111000050;;;;;;

Here, we present a feasible method for fibers' continuous collection and morphology optimization by utilizing vertical electrostatic-assisted centrifugal spinning (E-CS). The effects of spinning parameters, such as applied voltage, nozzle size, and rotational speed on fiber morphology have been evaluated systematically. We find that vertical voltage is strongly correlated with the formation of bead defects, and nozzle size is the most important parameter on fiber size, and the fiber diameter generally decreased with increasing rotation speed. Through the mechanism analysis and jet trajectory observation, we think that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is the key factor in determining fiber formation in CS. When a vertical electrostatic force is applied to CS, the above instability phenomenon can be effectively controlled resulting more uniform fibers with thinner diameters and fewer beads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0040-5175;1746-7748;;;;NOV;2017;87;19;;;;;2349;2357;;10.1177/0040517516671121;;;;;;;WOS:000412813000005;;;;;;

We used a discretized model, which provides a numerical framework to solve complex continuum equations, to model the spinning behavior of the viscoelastic Boger fluid. The jet was modeled as a series of beads connected with massless springs. After defining the viscoelastic, surface tension and aerodynamic drag forces for each bead, we solve Newton's second law of motion to obtain the trajectory of the jet. We first compared the jet profile predictions of the Newtonian fluid from the bead-spring model with an asymptotic thin-fiber model and obtained consistent results. Finally, we performed a parameter study to understand the effects of various properties such as viscoelasticity, surface tension and process conditions on the behavior of the viscoelastic jet. We also compared the simulation results with the experimental observations of PIB/PB Boger fluids to validate the discretized model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, recycled bottle-grade polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, and polypropylene were spun into fibers from the melt using a centrifugal spinning technique. Mono-component fibers and 50/50 blends of each polymer and a 33/33/33 blend of all three polymers were evaluated. Fiber morphology, chemistry, thermal, and mechanical properties were probed. Fiber diameters ranged from ca. 1 to over 12 mu m, with polypropylene fibers having the smallest fiber diameters. Mono-component fibers were generally defect-free, while composite fibers containing polypropylene were beady. Fibers made from polyethylene terephthalate had the highest tensile strength, and the addition of polyethylene terephthalate to the other polymers improved the mechanical properties of the blends. Nano- and micro-fibers from both pure and mixed waste streams are expected to have applications in myriad areas such as ultra/micro-filtration, composites, and insulation.;;;;;Gillan, Margaret/0000-0002-6061-6881;;;;;;;;;;;;1996-1944;;;;;SEP;2017;10;9;;;;;;;1044;10.3390/ma10091044;;;;;;;WOS:000411506700058;28878187;;;;;

Film-fiber hybrid nonwoven mats are formed during fiber processing and converted to carbon structures after a simple thermal treatment. This contrasts with multistep methods that attempt to mix previously prepared graphene and fibers, or require complicated and costly processes for deposition of graphene over carbon fibers. The developed graphene-fiber hybrid structures have seamless connections between graphene and fibers, and in fact the graphene veils extend directly from one fiber into another forming a continuous surface. The graphene-fiber hybrid structures are produced in situ from aqueous poly(vinyl alcohol) solutions. The solutions were subjected to centrifugal spinning to produce fine nanofiber mats. The addition of salt to the polymer solution stimulated a capillarity effect that promoted the formation of thin veils, which become graphene sheets upon dehydration by sulfuric acid vapor followed by carbonization (at relatively low temperatures, below 800 degrees C). These veils extend over several micrometers within the pores of the fiber network, and consist of crystalline graphene layers that cross-link the fibers to form a highly interconnected hybrid network. The surface area and pore diameter of the hybrid structures were measured to be 521 m(2)g(-1) and 10 nm, respectively. The resulting structure shows high electrical conductivity, 550 S/m, and promising shielding of electromagnetic interference, making it an attractive system for a broad range of electronic applications.;;;;Sun, Hongyu/E-8567-2011- Arandiyan, Hamidreza/B-5593-2013- Mao, Yuanbing/R-4521-2017- Rodriguez-Macias, Fernando J/A-9841-2013- Arandiyan, Hamid/O-3219-2019;Sun, Hongyu/0000-0002-5072-7019- Arandiyan, Hamidreza/0000-0001-5633-3945- Mao, Yuanbing/0000-0003-2665-6676- Rodriguez-Macias, Fernando J/0000-0002-4319-5608- Arandiyan, Hamid/0000-0001-5633-3945- Lozano, Karen/0000-0002-6676-8632;;;;;;;;;;;;1944-8244;;;;;AUG 2;2017;9;30;;;;;25474;25480;;10.1021/acsami.7b07509;;;;;;;WOS:000407089300046;28701040;;;;;

At first, a three-dimensional network of SiO2 precursor fibers was produced from tailored spun solutions (without any toxic elements and surfactants) by centrifugal spinning, which is a very modern fiber-synthesis technique, with numerous advantages over electrospinning. Upon thermal annealing of the precursor fibers, mesoporous amorphous SiO2 fibers with an ultrahigh surface area of up to 824 m(2)/g and pore size distribution in the range of 2-10 nm were produced. Owing to the high number of OH groups available on the surface, the produced SiO2 fibers showed significantly better performance in H2O adsorption compared to that of the reference silicagel.;;;;Bulanek, Roman/G-3299-2019;Bulanek, Roman/0000-0002-9926-6823- Macak, Jan/0000-0001-7091-3022;;;;;;;;;;;;2470-1343;;;;;AUG;2017;2;8;;;;;5052;5059;;10.1021/acsomega.7b00770;;;;;;;WOS:000409924000108;31457782;;;;;

M.;;;Regularized string model for nanofibre formation in centrifugal spinning methods;JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS;;;;;;;;;;;;We develop a general regularized thin-fibre (string) model to predict the properties of non-Newtonian fluid fibres generated by centrifugal spinning. In this process the fibre emerges from a nozzle of a spinneret that rotates rapidly around its axis of symmetry, in the presence of centrifugal, Coriolis, inertial, viscous/shear-thinning, surface tension and gravitational forces. We analyse the effects of five important dimensionless groups, namely, the Rossby number (Rb), the Reynolds number (Re), the Weber number (We), the Froude number (Fr) and a power-law index (m), on the steady state trajectory and thinning of fibre radius. In particular, we find that the gravitational force mainly affects the fibre vertical angle at small arc lengths as well as the fibre trajectory. We show that for small Rb, which is the regime of nanofibre formation in centrifugal spinning methods, rapid thinning of the fibre radius occurs over small arc lengths, which becomes more pronounced as Re increases or m decreases. At larger arc lengths, a relatively large We results in a spiral trajectory regime, where the fibre eventually recovers a corresponding inviscid limit with a slow thinning of the fibre radius as a function of the arc length. Viscous forces do not prevent the fibre from approaching the inviscid limit, but very strong surface tension forces may do so as they could even result in a circular trajectory with an almost constant fibre radius. We divide the spiral and circular trajectories into zones of no thinning, intense thinning and slow or ceased thinning, and for each zone we provide simple expressions for the fibre radius as a function of the arc length.;;;;Noroozi, Sooran/ABE-7125-2020- Taghavi, Seyed Mohammad/L-4700-2016;Taghavi, Seyed Mohammad/0000-0003-2263-0460- Arne, Walter/0000-0001-5364-3788;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-1120;1469-7645;;;;JUL 10;2017;822;;;;;;202;234;;10.1017/jfm.2017.279;;;;;;;WOS:000403090300015;;;;;;

Fibres were spun from solution using a range of polymer concentrations, spin speeds and spinneret to collector distances. A PHBV polymer concentration of 25% w/v spun at 9000 r min(-1) produced the highest quality fibres, with fibre diameters predominantly in the 0.5-3 mu m range. The rate at which fibre could be produced at the 9000 r min(-1) spin speed and with a spinneret to collector distance of 39.2 cm was equivalent to 11 km of fibre per minute per needle. Average fibre strengths of 3 MPa were achieved, together with average moduli of 100 MPa, indicating that the fibres had higher strength but lower stiffness than electrospun PHBV. The productivity and mechanical properties achieved, together with the excellent biocompatibility of PHBV, means that these fibres have potential for application in a range of biomedical applications.

However, traditional heart valve tissue engineering has relied on resource-intensive, cell-based manufacturing, which increases cost and hinders clinical translation. To overcome these limitations, in situ tissue engineering approaches aim to develop scaffold materials and manufacturing processes that elicit endogenous tissue remodeling and repair. Yet despite recent advances in synthetic materials manufacturing, there remains a lack of cell-free, automated approaches for rapidly producing biomimetic heart valve scaffolds. Here, we designed a jet spinning process for the rapid and automated fabrication of fibrous heart valve scaffolds. The composition, multiscale architecture, and mechanical properties of the scaffolds were tailored to mimic that of the native leaflet fibrosa and assembled into three dimensional, semilunar valve structures. We demonstrated controlled modulation of these scaffold parameters and show initial biocompatibility and functionality in vitro. Valves were minimally-invasively deployed via transapical access to the pulmonary valve position in an ovine model and shown to be functional for 15 h. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the high content of amorphous sucrose in the formulations, such microfibers may be highly hygroscopic and unstable on storage. In this study, we explore both the effects of water uptake of the microfibers and the consequences of deliberate recrystallization for the associated dissolution profiles. The stability of sucrose microfibers loaded with three selected BCS class II model drugs (itraconazole (ITZ), olanzapine (OLZ), and piroxicam (PRX)) was investigated under four different relative humidity conditions (11, 33, 53, and 75% RH) at 25 degrees C for 8 months, particularly focusing on the effect of the highest level of moisture (75% RH) on the morphology, size, drug distribution, physical state, and dissolution performance of microfibers. While all samples were stable at 11% RH, at 33% RH the ITZ sucrose system showed greater resistance against devitrification compared to the OLZ and PRX sucrose systems. For all three samples, the freshly prepared microfibers showed enhanced dissolution and supersaturation compared to the drug alone and physical mixes- surprisingly, the dissolution advantage was largely maintained or even enhanced (in the case of ITZ) following the moisture-induced recrystallization under 75% RH. Therefore, this study suggests that the moisture-induced recrystallization process may result in considerable dissolution enhancement compared to the drug alone, while overcoming the physical stability risks associated with the amorphous state.;;;;Aliev, Abil E/A-9934-2009;Barker, Susan/0000-0003-4880-0253- Craig, Duncan/0000-0003-1294-8993;;;;;;;;;;;;1543-8384;;;;;MAY;2017;14;5;;;;;1666;1680;;10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01126;;;;;;;WOS:000400633300033;28296409;;;;;

We performed dPCR reactions with a high dynamic range through the MiCA approach, and demonstrated that this cost-effective method not only eliminates the usage of complex microfluidic devices and control systems, but also greatly suppresses the loss of materials and cross-contamination.

A combination of different parameters including EC/PVP ratios, ethanol/water ratios and rheological properties are investigated to demonstrate pore formation. The specific surface area of EC/PVP fibers increases more than 11 times when the binary solvent contains 30% water. However, fibers with porous structure cannot be obtained in electrospinning process under the same solution and ambient conditions. The result indicates that the spinning method greatly influences the diameter and solvent evaporation of the jets, and as a consequence, fiber morphology varies in the two spinning processes.

Production of nanofibers comprised of charged polymers or polymers requiring nonvolatile solvents thus typically requires customization of spinning setup and polymer dope. In severe cases, these challenges can hinder fiber formation entirely. Here, a versatile system is presented which addresses these challenges by employing centrifugal force to extrude polymer dope jet through an air gap, into a flowing precipitation bath. This voltage-free approach ensures that nanofiber solidification occurs in liquid, minimizing surface tension instability that results in jet breakup and fiber defects. In addition, nanofibers of controlled size and morphology can be fabricated by tuning spinning parameters including air gap length, spinning speed, poly-mer concentration, and bath composition. To demonstrate the versatility of our platform, para-aramid (e.g., Kevlar) and biopolymer (e.g., DNA, alginate) nanofibers are produced that cannot be readily produced using standard nanofiber production methods.;;;;MacQueen, Luke/AAT-9348-2020;Lind, Johan Ulrik/0000-0002-0358-3999;;;;;;;;;;;;1438-7492;1439-2054;;;;JAN;2017;302;1;;;;;;;1600365;10.1002/mame.201600365;;;;;;;WOS:000396394700008;;;;;;

RJS is a simple method, which fabricates three-dimensional fibers by exploiting a high-speed rotating nozzle, creating a polymer jet which stretches until solidification, and does not require high voltage. In opposite, electrospinning technique needs the presence of an external electric field to create fiber from the polymeric jet solution. This article investigates both processes using two different biocompatible polymers: Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and Poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL). Samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimeter, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Morphological observations showed the efficiency of both techniques in obtaining nanofibers. Thermal analyses of data indicate immiscible property of different blends and the total solvent evaporation.

Here we present a novel manufacturing method for multi material composite nanofabrics. Using infrared spectroscopy and tensile testing, we compare the mechanical and structural properties of multi-material fabrics and single fiber blends. We find that multi-material nylon/polyurethane fabrics are tougher than their pure components, and that mechanical properties of composite nanofabrics can be tuned by varying the polymer ratio and composition. The capability of this system to fabricate nanotextiles using orthogonal solvents is also demonstrated.;;;;;Lind, Johan Ulrik/0000-0002-0358-3999;;;;;;;;;;;;1944-9399;1944-9380;978-1-5090-3029-3- 978-1-5090-3028-6;;;;2017;;;;;;;715;719;;;;;;;;;WOS:000434647500166;;;;;;

M.- Peijs, Ton;;;Rotary jet spinning review - a potential high yield future for polymer nanofibers;NANOCOMPOSITES;;;;;;;;;;;;Polymeric nanofibers have been the focus of much research due to their continually evolving applications in fields such as biomedicine, tissue engineering, composites, filtration, battery separators, and energy storage. Although several methods of producing nanofibers have shown promise for large scale production, none have yet produced large enough volumes at a low cost to be the front runner in the field, and therefore the preferred choice for industrialization. Rotary jet spinning (RJS) could be the answer to high throughput, low cost, and environmentally friendly nanofiber production. Being exploited in only the last decade, it is a technology that has seen relatively little research, but one which could potentially be the answer to large scale manufacturing of polymer nanofibers. In this review, we focus on fundamental processing characteristics and initial application driven research. A comparison between existing nanofiber production methods is drawn with the key differences noted. Two methods of utilizing RJS in nanofiber production are discussed, namely spinning from a polymer melt, and solution-based spinning as is typically used in more traditional methods such as electrospinning. Modeling of the process is introduced, in which material selection and processing parameters play an important role.;;;;Peijs, Ton/A-7309-2010- Rogalski, James/M-5263-2014;Peijs, Ton/0000-0002-6686-6005- Rogalski, James/0000-0001-9928-969X;;;;;;;;;;;;2055-0324;2055-0332;;;;;2017;3;4;;;;;97;121;;10.1080/20550324.2017.1393919;;;;;;;WOS:000424579900001;;;;;;

This is important for cell-free scaffolds in regenerativemedicine. The scaffold topology is crucial for cell-scaffold interactions and plays a pivotal role in stimulation of cell adhesion and proliferation through affecting cell morphology and intercellular contacts. The aim of this study was to characterise proliferation of different skin cells on core-shell 2D and 3D nano-and microfibre scaffolds from poly-3caprolactone loaded with lyophilised platelets. The electrospinning technique forms dense fibrous 2D scaffolds with limited cell infiltration, whereas the centrifugal spinning enables deep cell penetration due to its open 3D structure. The core of the prepared fibres was loaded with lyophilised platelet fraction and its release was controlled by the Pluronic F-68 concentration. This resulted in the preparation of functionalized scaffolds with a tuneable sustained release lasting more than 30 days. Two dermal cell lines, keratinocytes and fibroblasts, were grown on these functionalized scaffolds. While keratinocytes, epithelial cells, proliferated significantly better on the 2D structure with optimal stimulation of cell proliferation on the scaffolds containing 5% PF-68, fibroblasts proliferated well both on the 2D and 3D scaffolds but with a higher initial adhesion on the 3D forcespun fibre scaffold. Furthermore, a dose-dependent stimulation of proliferation by the released platelet lyophilisate was shown. We have concluded that beside the scaffold composition and its functionalization with bioactive molecules, the scaffold structure plays a significant role in regenerative medicine and dermal tissue engineering.;;;;Lukasova, Vera/AAC-4914-2019- Lukasova, Vera/O-9750-2017;Vocetkova, Karolina/0000-0002-5664-0109- Sovkova, Vera/0000-0002-4618-9828- Lukasova, Vera/0000-0003-0227-3347- Filova, Eva/0000-0003-1028-605X- Buzgo, Matej/0000-0002-0822-3319;;;;;;;;;;;;2046-2069;;;;;;2017;7;85;;;;;53706;53719;;10.1039/c7ra08728d;;;;;;;WOS:000416831000007;;;;;;

Collagen type I accounts for up to 90% of the collagen found in the body and it can be isolated and purified in large quantities and processed into a variety of forms. With respect to the process of the treatment of collagen into the nano-fibrous and submicron-fibrous forms, severe conditions leading to the denaturation of the collagen and thus the gelatin content should be avoided. Centrifugal force spinning and electrospinning processes appear to present promising methods for the spinning of collagen solutions. This paper deals with a comparison of the various methods applied in the processing of collagen, i.e. principally needle and needleless centrifugal spinning technology and electrospinning technology. In addition, the effect of process parameters and collagen solution conditions on the final form of the material was analyzed. Spun layers were prepared based on collagen type I isolated from calf skin. Nano-structured layers were prepared employing the spinning of 4-16 wt% collagen solutions in phosphate buffer saline and ethanol.

Among several heat insulators, inorganic fibrous heat-insulators have various merits, but production costs are still high. This work proposes a fabrication process of water glass fibers by centrifugal spinning using a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium silicate as spinning solution. It was found that fiber thickness and distribution are strongly affected by the process parameters, and that larger centrifugal gravity provides thinner and more uniform fibers. In contrast, the viscosity of spinning solution scarcely affected the thickness and uniformity of fibers, and a spinning solution with viscosity of more than 3 Pa.s and less than 150 Pa.s gave fibers stably. Humidity-resistant fibers were produced by carbon dioxide gas treatment at over 100 degrees C. Thermal conductivity measurement revealed that the optimal value was 0.027W/(m.K), which is comparable to that of air in the absence of convection. This value was similar to that of commercially available glass wool, but the mass of fiber required was about one-half, which would be effective for cost reduction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0386-216X;;;;;;2017;43;3;;;;;145;149;;10.1252/kakoronbunshu.43.145;;;;;;;WOS:000405524100002;;;;;;

Herein, we present a novel and simple centrifugal spinning technology that extrudes fibers from polymer solutions by using a high-speed rotary, perforated spinneret. By controlling the concentration of the spinning solutions and adjusting the spinning parameters, polystyrene (PS) fibers with different structures have been prepared. Since PS is a low surface energy material, the surface roughness can further increase the hydrophobicity of the fibers. We prepared hydrophobic SiO2 in different sizes, mixed them with PS dissolved in DMF, and SiO2/PS fibers were obtained by centrifugal spinning, where the maximum water contact angle of SiO2/PS fibers was 151 degrees with superhydrophobicity. The typical surface of the silver ragwort leaf fibers with numerous grooves, and the lotus leaf with nano-protrusions, were successfully imitated on the centrifugally-spun SiO2/PS fiber surface. The as-prepared PS fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and water contact angle/sliding angle measurements, and a processing-structure-performance relationship was established. Results demonstrate that the fiber morphology can be easily manipulated by controlling the spinning parameters, and centrifugal spinning is a promising approach for meeting the growing demand for the mass production of superhydrophobic micro/nano fibers.;;;;Zhang, Xiangwu/F-1013-2011;Zhang, Xiangwu/0000-0002-6236-6281;;;;;;;;;;;;2046-2069;;;;;;2017;7;18;;;;;11041;11048;;10.1039/c6ra25813a;;;;;;;WOS:000395796700054;;;;;;

The successful core/shell fibre formation and discontinuous morphology of the core was identified by confocal microscopy. Encapsulation of a model enzyme resulted in protection of enzymatic activity and release during the first 7 days. The feasibility for tissue engineering applications was demonstrated by the incorporation of platelet lyophilisates as a source of growth factors.

Therefore, scaffolds for their regeneration should support cell infiltration and growth in all 3 dimensions. To fulfill such a requirement, the materials should possess large, open pores. Centrifugal spinning is a simple method for producing 3D fibrous scaffolds with large and interconnected pores. However, the process of bone regeneration is rather complex and requires additional stimulation by active molecules. In the current study, we introduced a simple composite scaffold based on platelet adhesion to poly-e-caprolactone 3D fibers. Platelets were used as a natural source of growth factors and cytokines active in the tissue repair process. By immobilization in the fibrous scaffolds, their bioavailability was prolonged. The biological evaluation of the proposed system in the MG-63 model showed improved metabolic activity, proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity in comparison to nonfunctionalized fibrous scaffold. In addition, the response of cells was dose dependent with improved biocompatibility with increasing platelet concentration.

Si nanoparticles were dispersed in PVA solutions and transformed into fine fibers using a centrifugal spinning technique given its potential for large scale production. The Si/PVA fibers mats were then subjected to dehydration by exposing them to sulfuric acid Vapor. The dehydration improved the thermal and chemical stability of the PVA matrix, allowing further carbonization at 800 degrees C.

However, insufficient energy density and low cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries hinder their practical use for next-generation smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Electrospun carbon microfibers have recently been introduced as a high-performance anode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, electrospinning is not feasible for mass production of carbon microfibers due to its complex processing condition, low production rate and high cost. Herein, we report centrifugal spinning, a high-rate and low-cost micro fiber production method, as an alternative approach to electrospinning for carbon microfiber production and introduce centrifugally-spun carbon microfibers (CMFs) and porous carbon microfibers (PCMFs) as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Electrochemical performance results indicated that the highly porous nature of centrifugally-spun PCMFs led to increased Na+ storage capacity and improved cycling stability. The reversible capacity of centrifugally-spun PCMF anodes at the 200th cycle was 242 mAh g(-1) which was much higher than that of centrifugally-spun CMFs (143 mAh g(-1)). The capacity retention and coulombic efficiency of the centrifugally-spun PCMF anodes were 89.0% and 99.9%, respectively, even at the 200th cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A series of fibres were prepared by using polyacrylonitrile (Pan), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and 50: 50 Pan-PMMA polymer solutions without pressure and with 0.2 MPa working pressure. The surface morphology of the nanofibres was analysed by scanning electron microscopy, and their thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetry and hot-stage microscopy. Nanofibres with a smooth surface were generated at 0.2 MPa working pressure, and those with a rough surface were generated without any working pressure. Porous Pan nanofibres were prepared by using PMMA as a sacrificial polymer. The 50:50 Pan-PMMA blend fibres were subjected to heat treatment to obtain porous fibres. The less thermally stable PMMA decomposes when heated, generating pores on the surface of the Pan fibres. The porous nanofibres have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio compared to smooth fibres, and these fibres could be useful in a variety of applications, such as tissue engineering, filtering and purification.;;;;ILLANGAKOON, Eranka/K-6675-2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;2050-6252;2050-6260;;;;SEP;2016;4;3;;;;;167;178;;10.1680/jsuin.16.00007;;;;;;;WOS:000388885500007;;;;;;

J.- Carr, Christopher M.;;;Centrifugal melt spinning of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/triacontene copolymer fibres;JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;Polyvinylpyrrolidone/1-triacontene (PVP/TA) copolymer fibre webs produced by centrifugal melt spinning were studied to determine the influence of jet rotation speed on morphology and internal structure as well as their potential utility as adsorbent capture media for disperse dye effluents. Fibres were produced at 72 degrees C with jet head rotation speeds from 7000 to 15,000 r min(-1). The fibres were characterised by means of SEM, XRD and DSC. Adsorption behaviour was investigated by means of an isothermal bottle point adsorption study using a commercial disperse dye, Dianix AC-E. Through centrifugal spinning nanofibers and microfibers could be produced with individual fibres as fine as 200-300 nm and mean fibre diameters of ca. 1-2 mu m. The PVP/TA fibres were mechanically brittle with characteristic brittle tensile fracture regions observed at the fibre ends. DSC and XRD analyses suggested that this brittleness was linked to the graft chain crystallisation where the PVP/TA was in the form of a radial brush copolymer. In this structure, the triacontene branches interlock and form small lateral crystals around an amorphous backbone. As an adsorbent, the PVP/TA fibres were found to adsorb 35.4 mg g(-1) compared to a benchmark figure of 30.0 mg g(-1) for a granular-activated carbon adsorbent under the same application conditions. PVP/TA is highly hydrophobic and adsorbs disperse dyes through the strong hydrophobic bonding interaction. Such fibrous assemblies may have applications in the targeted adsorption and separation of non-polar species from aqueous or polar environments.;;;;;Russell, Stephen/0000-0003-0339-9611;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-2461;1573-4803;;;;AUG;2016;51;16;;;;;7512;7522;;10.1007/s10853-016-0030-5;;;;;;;WOS:000378542300012;;;;;;

The effects of PCL concentration, solvent mixture, and the spinneret rotational speed on fiber formation were evaluated. The concentration of the polymer in the solvents was a critical determinant of the solution viscosity. Lower PCL concentrations resulted in low solution viscosities with a correspondingly low fiber production rate with many beads. Bead-free fibers with high production rate and uniform fiber diameter distribution were obtained from the optimum PCL concentration (i.e., 12.5 wt%) with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent. The addition of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to the THF solvent promoted the gradual formation of beads, split fibers, and generally affected the distribution of fiber diameters. The crystallinity of PCL fibers was also affected by the processing conditions, spinning speed, and solvent mixture.;;;;Mao, Yuanbing/R-4521-2017;Mao, Yuanbing/0000-0003-2665-6676;;;;;;;;;;;;;2079-6439;;;;JUN;2016;4;2;;;;;;;20;10.3390/fib4020020;;;;;;;WOS:000380256100009;;;;;;

M.;;;Development of micro-fibrous solid dispersions of poorly water-soluble drugs in sucrose using temperature-controlled centrifugal spinning;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS;;;;;;;;;;;;Solid dispersion technology represents a successful approach to addressing the bioavailability issues caused by the low aqueous solubility of many Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II drugs. In this study, the use of high-yield manufacture of fiber-based dispersion is explored as an alternative approach to monolith production methods. A temperature-controlled solvent-free centrifugal spinning process was used to produce sucrose-based microfibers containing the poorly water-soluble drugs olanzapine and piroxicam (both BCS Class II)- these were successfully incorporated into the micro fibers and the basic characteristics of fiber diameter, glassy behavior, drug loading capacity and drug sucrose interaction assessment were measured. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that bead-free drug-loaded microfibers with homogenous morphology and diameter in the range of a few micrometers were prepared using our process. Differential scanning calorimetric and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that both drug and carrier were present in the amorphous state in the microfibers, although in the case of piroxicam-loaded microfibers, the presence of small amounts of crystalline drug was observed under polarized light microscopy and in Fourier transform infrared spectra. Drug dissolution performance was evaluated under both sink and non-sink conditions and was found to be significantly enhanced compared to the corresponding crystalline physical mixtures and pure drugs, with evidence of supersaturation behavior noted under non-sink conditions. This study has demonstrated that microfiber-based dispersions may be manufactured by the centrifugal spinning process and may possess characteristics that are favorable for the enhanced dissolution and oral absorption of drugs.

However, fabrication of fibrous materials with high POSS content has been a challenge because of the aggregation and solubility limits of POSS units. In this paper, we describe a robust and environmentally friendly fabrication approach of inorganic-organic hybrid POSS fibers by integrating UV initiated thiol-ene polymerization and centrifugal fiber spinning. The use of monomeric liquids in this approach not only reduces the consumption of heat energy and solvent, but it also promotes homogeneous mixing of organic and inorganic components that allows integration of large amount of POSS (up to 80 wt %) into the polymer network. The POSS containing thiol-ene fibers exhibited enhanced thermomechanical properties compared to purely organic analogs as revealed by substantial increases in residual weight and a factor of 4 increase in modulus after thermal treatment at 1000 degrees C. This simple fabrication approach combined with the tunability in fiber properties afforded by tailoring monomer composition make POSS containing thiol-ene fibers attractive candidates for catalyst supports and filtration media, particularly in high-temperature and harsh environments.;;;;Fang, Yichen/J-8125-2019;Ha, Heonjoo/0000-0001-7695-2399;;;;;;;;;;;;1944-8244;1944-8252;;;;MAY 4;2016;8;17;;;;;11050;11059;;10.1021/acsami.6b01692;;;;;;;WOS:000375520700048;27057758;;;;;

Several parameters such as the concentration of SnCl4, rotational speed, and diameter of the spinneret were discussed to determine the optimum spinning conditions. The obtained as-spun fibers and SnO2 ultra-fine fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the low-temperature gas-sensing properties of the SnO2 sample were systematically investigated. The results proved that the SnO2 sample had good sensitivity for a variety of measured gases at low temperature. Among these, the SnO2 sensor showed the highest sensitivity for HCl gas, and the sensitivity for ethanol gas increased rapidly when its concentration exceeded 1200 ppm. Our results demonstrated that the centrifugal spinning could be a potential approach for preparing the SnO2 gas sensor.

The as-prepared SnO2 microfibers were further treated with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of acetylene using different durations of 30, 60, and 90 min. The surfaces of the CVD-treated SnO2 microfibers are covered with thin carbon layers, and the surface nanoparticles on the SnO2 microfibers were reduced by carbon, producing nano-sized Sn/C whiskers grafted on the backbones. The X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry results demonstrate that longer CVD coating duration promotes the formation of Sn/C whiskers on the SnO2 microfibers. The thin carbon coating layers help stabilize the solid electrolyte interface formation while the grafted Sn/C whiskers facilitate better electrolyte-electrode contact. Hence, the CVD-treated SnO2 microfibers exhibit higher initial capacities than the pristine SnO2 microfibers, as well as enhanced capacity retentions after cycling. The results suggest that centrifugal spinning is a promising approach to produce fibrous electrode materials in a rapid and mass production fashion, and the CVD coating process is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of the SnO2-based electrode materials.;;;;Zhang, Xiangwu/F-1013-2011- Fu, Kun/AAY-8189-2020- tem, mel/ABB-2890-2020- yanilmaz, meltem/AAH-4065-2020;Zhang, Xiangwu/0000-0002-6236-6281- Fu, Kun/0000-0003-4963-615X- tem, mel/0000-0003-0562-5715- yanilmaz, meltem/0000-0003-0562-5715- Dirican, Mahmut/0000-0002-2559-6467;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-2461;1573-4803;;;;MAY;2016;51;9;;;;;4549;4558;;10.1007/s10853-016-9768-z;;;;;;;WOS:000370342100035;;;;;;

Several spinning parameters including the concentration of FeCl3, rotational speed and diameter of spinneret were discussed for determination of optimum spinning condition. The resultant as-spun fibers and hollow Fe2O3 ultra-fine fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), FT-IR spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the diameters of the as-spun fibers and the hollow Fe2O3 ultra-fine fibers were 1.0-6.0 mu m and 0.5-5.0 mu m, respectively. The concentration of FeCl3 had an impact on as-spun fibers hardly, but on diameters of the hollow Fe2O3 ultra-fine fibers. The diameters of the as-spun fibers become smaller and the hollow Fe2O3 ultra-fine fibers become more fragile when the rotational speed increased or the inner diameter of the spinneret decreased.

Through systematic investigation, it was found that the average fiber diameter has a strong dependence on monomer delivery rate through the orifice, which can be intuitively linked to both the orifice diameter and monomer mixture viscosity. On the other hand, the breadth of the fiber diameter distribution can be controlled by the spin speed of the rotating spinneret. Carefully tuning these process parameters allows near independent control of average fiber diameter and its distribution, which could provide access to a widely tailorable range of fibers appropriate for different applications. Finally, under optimized process conditions, crosslinked fibers with average diameters of approximately 1.5 mu m can be produced, which are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than photocured fibers fabricated in previous reports and comparable with the smallest melt blown nonwoven fibers produced commercially. Coupled with the advantages of cross-linked fibers made by in-situ photopolymerization, the capability to produce small fibers with tailored diameter distributions by centrifugal spinning could further establish this technology as a competitive alternative to existing approaches.

We herein report the use of a new scalable technique, Forcespinning (FS) to produce binder-free porousSn/C composite nanofibers with different Sn particle size loading. The preparation process involves the FS of Sn/PAN precursor nanofibers and subsequently stabilizing in air at 280 C followed by carbonization at 800 C under an inert atmosphere. The Sn/C composite nanofibers are highly flexible and were directly used as binder-free anodes for lithium-ion batteries. The produced Sn/C composite nanofibers showed an improved discharge capacity of about 724 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) for over 50 cycles compared to most nanofiber electrodes prepared by electrospinning and centrifugal spinning. The FS method clearly produces Sn/C nanofiber composite electrodes that have a high specific capacity and excellent cyclic performance, owing to the unique structure and properties of the nanofibers. The FS technology is thus a viable method for the large scale production of nano/micro fibers for battery electrodes, separators, and other applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to report results on the use of Forcespinning technology to produce composite nanofiber anodes for lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, starches of amylopectin content above 65% cannot be fabricated to fiber by electrospinning. This paper is focus on the centrifugal spinnability of amylopectin rich starches. We investigated the amylopectin content of starches by Dual-wavelength colorimetry, studied the rheological properties of starch dopes to determine entanglement concentration (c(e)) by rotary rheometer. Results indicated that amylopectin rich native corn and potato starches, which with amylopectin content higher than 65%, were suitable for centrifugal spinning to micro-to-nanofibers. Additionally, starch-based fibers were successfully fabricated from the amylose rich corn starch as well. Rheological studies showed that the entanglement concentration (c(e)) of starch solution was crucial for successful centrifugal spinning. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Further, the obtained composite fibres are subsequently processed using pre-oxidation and carbonisation treatments in order to obtain hollow carbon microfibres. The effects of different respective PVP and PAN concentrations in the inner and outer solutions (the solutions injected into the inner and outer centrifugal tubes, respectively) on the product morphology are discussed. It is found that hollow carbon microfibres can only be fabricated for concurrent inner PVP and outer PAN solution concentrations of 14-17 and 13-16 wt%, respectively. If either of the solution concentrations is too low, droplets are formed, whereas the spinneret becomes blocked and cannot spin if either of these concentrations is too high. The diameters of the coaxial fibres and hollow carbon fibres can be controlled between 3 and 10 mu m.

K.;;;Fibrous scaffolds for building hearts and heart parts;ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS;;;;;;;;;;;;Extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and biochemistry provide cell-instructive cues that promote and regulate tissue growth, function, and repair. From a structural perspective, the ECM is a scaffold that guides the self-assembly of cells into distinct functional tissues. The ECM promotes the interaction between individual cells and between different cell types, and increases the strength and resilience of the tissue in mechanically dynamic environments. From a biochemical perspective, factors regulating cell-ECM adhesion have been described and diverse aspects of cell-ECM interactions in health and disease continue to be clarified. Natural ECMs therefore provide excellent design rules for tissue engineering scaffolds. The design of regenerative three-dimensional (3D) engineered scaffolds is informed by the target ECM structure, chemistry, and mechanics, to encourage cell infiltration and tissue genesis. This can be achieved using nanofibrous scaffolds composed of polymers that simultaneously recapitulate 3D ECM architecture, high-fidelity nanoscale topography, and bio-activity. Their high porosity, structural anisotropy, and bio-activity present unique advantages for engineering 3D anisotropic tissues. Here, we use the heart as a case study and examine the potential of ECM-inspired nanofibrous scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering. We asked: Do we know enough to build a heart? To answer this question, we tabulated structural and functional properties of myocardial and valvular tissues for use as design criteria, reviewed nanofiber manufacturing platforms and assessed their capabilities to produce scaffolds that meet our design criteria. Our knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the heart, as well as our ability to create synthetic ECM scaffolds have advanced to the point that valve replacement with nanofibrous scaffolds may be achieved in the short term, while myocardial repair requires further study in vitro and in vivo.

CNF is expected to various applications. However, CNF have a high cost of production. Therefore, we are trying to reduce a cost to make a preparation of the CNF precursor using Cotton Candy Method (CoCaM). The CoCaM is a novel method that can fabricate large amount of nano fiber. The feature of CoCaM is used to forming a fiber with only air injection. Therefore, it is possible to make a cost saving by CoCaM, because it does not need to heating and using the electric field. We studied producing PAN nano fibers by CoCaM and carbonizing conditions for nanofibers. We found the factor that PAN concentration, air pressure and feeding speed affected diameter of nano fiber. The average nano PAN fiber diameter changed from macro- to nano- meters under the CoCaM. After carbonization, we obverted that CNF were same shape of the PAN nano fiber. However, the diameter of CNF was decreased. The Raman spectrometry of nano carbon fiber by CoCaM showed high crystallinity.

The highest capacity achieved is 567mAhg(-1) at 20mAg(-1). At a much higher current density of 640mAg(-1), the microfiber electrode still retains a high capacity of 158mAhg(-1) after 50 cycles. The SnO2 microfibers also demonstrate good rate performance in a current range of 20-640mAg(-1). The results demonstrate that SnO2 microfibers are a potential anode material candidate for sodium-ion batteries and that centrifugal spinning offers a feasible solution for the large-scale production of fibrous electrode materials.;;;;Zhang, Xiangwu/F-1013-2011- yanilmaz, meltem/AAH-4065-2020- tem, mel/ABB-2890-2020;Zhang, Xiangwu/0000-0002-6236-6281- yanilmaz, meltem/0000-0003-0562-5715- tem, mel/0000-0003-0562-5715- Dirican, Mahmut/0000-0002-2559-6467;;;;;;;;;;;;2196-0216;;;;;DEC;2015;2;12;;;;;1947;1956;;10.1002/celc.201500367;;;;;;;WOS:000368364700013;;;;;;

The investigation was conducted using Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids to study the effect of viscoelasticity, driving force, and the flow rate on the initial thinning behavior, jet contour shapes, and radii. Boger fluids based on Newtonian polybutene and viscoelastic polyisobutylene were utilized as test fluids in the current study. Our results reveal that increasing the viscoelasticity leads to a faster initial thinning of the polymer jet. However, the effect is strongly coupled with the rotation speed, and due to a faster increase in extensional viscosity for highly viscoelastic fluids, the thinning slows down with the increase in the angular velocity. Initial thinning is shown to be faster for the lower flow rates. Viscoelasticity and centrifugal force have a significant influence on the jet contour radii. The maximum radius will decrease for more viscoelastic fluids, and with the increase in angular velocity due to the development of the elastic hoop stress. The comparison of experiments with the discretized element modeling with the FENE-P model confirms the model predictive potential for the thinning behavior. Finally, the centrifugal spinning experiments are compared to electrospinning in order to observe a qualitative similarity.

This optical fiber is made by the coating of a thin layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) nanofibers. ITO nanofibers are fabricated via centrifugal spinning process and wrap around the quartz optical fiber. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, UV-Vis spectrophotometer, Avometer and Luminance colorimeter are used to characterize the morphology, crystal structure and photoelectric properties of ITO-coated optical fiber.

Compared to the Li-free fibers, the Li-substituted Na layered transition metal oxide fiber cathodes exhibit higher capacities, better cycling stability and enhanced rate capability. Among the studied Li-substituted Na layered transition metal oxide fibers, Na0.8Li0.4Ni0.15Mn0.55Co0.1O2 demonstrates the best overall electrochemical performance. The highest capacity of 138 mA h g(-1) is achieved at 15 mA g(-1). As the current density increased to 75 and 300 mA g(-1), Na0.8Li0.4Ni0.15Mn0.55Co0.1O2 fibers still deliver high capacities of 113 and 94 mA h g(-1), respectively. This specific fiber composition also yields stable cycling performance and superior rate performance at various current densities between 15-600 mA g(-1). The results suggest that partial Li substitution is an effective method to stabilize the structure of the Na layered transition metal oxide cathodes and hence enhance the electrochemical performance, It is also demonstrated that centrifugal spinning can be an attractive technology for mass production of micro-sized, fibrous electrodes.

We observed that simultaneous Forcespinning and photopolymerization resulted in a wide variety of fiber morphologies including beads, beads-on-string, uniform fiber, fused fibers, and well-cured fibers. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms and parameter interactions that give rise to these morphologies, we systematically varied the light intensity, solution elasticity, and spin speed of the Forcespinning process. From these experimental results, an operating diagram was constructed based on the measured process parameters, their respective timescales, and observed effects on fiber morphology. While numerous parameters can individually affect fiber formation and morphology, the interplay between curing kinetics, solution viscoelasticity, and orifice-to-collector processing time window is also crucial in this process. Smooth and well-cured fibers were formed only when the photopolymerization occurred sufficiently quickly, before both the breakup of fibers into droplets due to a surface tension driven Rayleigh instability and the deposition of fibers on the collector. Our findings can serve as a predictive guideline for the fabrication of crosslinked fibers with desired morphology, the implementation of the in-situ polymerization and spinning concept into other commercial fiber manufacturing technologies, and the adaptation of other functional or high performance monomer systems.

Solutions of two different commercially available silicone resins and a mixture of a silicone resin and graphene were used, and a polymer (polyvynilpyrolidone) was added to aid the fibre generation process. The fibre diameter and the morphology of the spun and the pyrolysed fibres were shown to be influenced by rotating speed, working pressure and the polymer concentration. Non-porous fibres were obtained using a low volatility binary solvent system and, after pyrolysis at high temperature, dense SiOC ceramic fibre bundles were produced.

However, the electrospinning process has some serious drawbacks, such as low spinning rate and high production cost. The centrifugal spinning technique can be used as a fast, cost-effective and safe technique to fabricate high-performance fiber-based separators. In this work, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes with different blend ratios were produced via centrifugal spinning and characterized by using different electrochemical techniques for use as separators in Li-ion batteries. Compared with commercial microporous polyolefin membrane, centrifugally-spun PMMA/PAN membranes had larger ionic conductivity, higher electrochemical oxidation limit, and lower interfacial resistance with lithium. Centrifugally-spun PMMA/PAN membrane separators were assembled into Li/LiFePO4 cells and these cells delivered high capacities and exhibited good cycling performance at room temperature. In addition, cells using centrifugally-spun PMMA/PAN membrane separators showed superior C-rate performance compared to those using microporous polypropylene (PP) membranes. It is, therefore, demonstrated that centrifugally-spun PMMA/PAN membranes are promising separator candidate for high-performance Li-ion batteries.;;;;yanilmaz, meltem/AAH-4065-2020- tem, mel/ABB-2890-2020- Zhang, Xiangwu/F-1013-2011;yanilmaz, meltem/0000-0003-0562-5715- tem, mel/0000-0003-0562-5715- Zhang, Xiangwu/0000-0002-6236-6281;;;;;;;;;;;;2073-4360;;;;;APR;2015;7;4;;;;;629;643;;10.3390/polym7040629;;;;;;;WOS:000353775800003;;;;;;

In the centrifugal spinning process, a polymer solution has been pushed by the centrifugal force through small nozzle of a rapidly rotating cylindrical drum. Thereby thin fibers are formed and collected on a collector in the form of a web. Centrifuge spinning suffered from a strong air resistance which leads to a more deflected jet as well as its rapidly solvent evaporation resulting in thicker nanofibers. In this work, centrifuge spinning has been equipped by a rotating collector, whereas the fabrication process was skillfully sealed from ambient airflow. A comparison was drawn between the trajectory of Newtonian liquid jets fabricated by centrifuge spinning and air-sealed centrifuge spinning. The captured images of the liquid jet trajectory using a high speed camera showed that non-isolated liquid jets were more curved than isolated liquid jets due to air resistance. A pre-presented non-linear analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations was carried out and the numerical solutions were compared with the experiments. There was fairly good agreement between the isolated jet trajectory and the model-predicted one, but there were differences between the non-isolated jet trajectory and the simulation results. The non-isolated jet curved more compared to the others due to air drag. Also, the diameter of polymeric nanofibers was predicted and compared with experiments. Some qualitative agreement was found.

This new setup obviously doubles the production rate of nanofibers relative to the conventional ECS. To investigate the effect of this modification on the degree of nanofibers alignment (DeNA), the values of DeNA were measured for 30 distinctive experiments and the results were compared with that of ECS setup with a single nozzle. The originality of this work has lain in the fact that for these 30 experiments, which were designed by Design Expert Software (DES), the DeNA of the new ECS was the same as the conventional setup. Additionally, a spinneret with four nozzles was employed to evaluate the influence of number of nozzles on the DeNA. Lastly, the optimum values of voltage, polymer concentration, spinneret rotational speed and collector diameter were determined in order to maximize the DeNA of the modified ECS setup.;;;;Khamforoush, Mehrdad/ABA-5027-2020;Khamforoush, Mehrdad/0000-0002-2752-0968;;;;;;;;;;;;1793-2920;1793-7094;;;;FEB;2015;10;2;;;;;;;1550016;10.1142/S1793292015500162;;;;;;;WOS:000352110300001;;;;;;

An inertial force is used to form fibrous jets made of viscous dispersions, which then solidify during solvent evaporation. Precursor suspensions were prepared with the use of water as the only solvent, non-toxic Fe2O3 ceramic powder and poly(ethylene oxide) - a fiber-forming agent. The obtained fibers were in the range of 0.2-1.4 mm in diameter. This work presents a concept that utilizes ceramic fibers that could potentially be used for arsenic removal based on adsorption-enhanced filtration. We prove that ceramic fibers can be formed by simply adding non-agglomerated particles to a polymer solution. The nonwoven fiber-based approach will allow higher flow rates of the filtrate during purification and enable heat treatment for cleaning the filters. However, by changing the type of particles and/or preparing a mixture of them, the application range of the final product can be significantly broadened.;;;;Schabikowski, Mateusz/F-6098-2014- Tomaszewska, Justyna/V-3417-2017- Tomaszewska, Justyna/AAS-5761-2020;Schabikowski, Mateusz/0000-0002-8166-855X- Tomaszewska, Justyna/0000-0002-2037-0768- Tomaszewska, Justyna/0000-0001-6883-7235;;;;;;;;;;;;0040-5175;1746-7748;;;;FEB;2015;85;3;;;;;316;324;;10.1177/0040517514542969;;;;;;;WOS:000348911900009;;;;;;

So far, carbon nanofibers have been mainly produced by electrospinning and subsequent heat treatments. However, the great difficulty of carbon nanofibers to be scaled up through electrospinning confines the productivity and practical application of this extensively investigated material category. Recently, centrifugal spinning has drawn attention due to its high production rate (500 times faster than traditional electrospinning), simple set-up, and ease of scaling-up. Herein, tin-containing carbon nanofibers were prepared by facile centrifugal spinning from tin chloride-polyacrylonitrile precursor solutions and subsequent thermal treatments. Polymer-salt-solvent relations and resultant rheological effects upon solution properties and fiber structures were discussed, and the performance of centrifugally spun tin-containing carbon nanofibers as anode material for lithium-ion batteries was evaluated. An excellent reversible capacity of 607 mAh g(-1) was achieved at the initial cycle and a relatively high specific capacity of 430 mAh g(-1) was maintained after 100 cycles. It is, therefore, demonstrated that centrifugal-spun tin-containing carbon nanofibers are promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries, and centrifugal spinning, as a nanofiber fabrication alternative to electrospinning, shows great potential in large-scale nanofiber production.;;;;Fu, Kun/AAY-8189-2020- Zhang, Xiangwu/F-1013-2011;Fu, Kun/0000-0003-4963-615X- Zhang, Xiangwu/0000-0002-6236-6281- Dirican, Mahmut/0000-0002-2559-6467;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-2461;1573-4803;;;;FEB;2015;50;3;;;;;1094;1102;;10.1007/s10853-014-8666-5;;;;;;;WOS:000346777800008;;;;;;

Electrospinning, the most common method to produce such fibers, has many limitations including low fiber output and solvent dependency. Centrifugal spinning is a new technique that uses centrifugal forces to form nano- and microfibers both from solution and the melt. In this work, the effect of melt temperature, collector distance, rotation speed, and concentration (for polymer solutions) of polycaprolactone were evaluated with respect to fiber morphology, diameter, alignment, and crystallinity. The fiber diameter generally decreased with increasing rotation speed and reduced concentration. Crystallinity for spun fibers decreased compared to the bulk polymer. Fiber alignment was improved with rotation speed for the melt-spun fibers. The fiber mats were evaluated as tissue scaffolds with neuronal PC12 cells. The cells adhered and extended neurites along the fibers for both melt and solution-spun scaffolds. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

However, the structure and property differences of nanofibers obtained from these two methods are unclear. In this paper, we will take regenerated silk fibroin (i.e., RSF) nanofibers as an example to reveal the differences. The centrifugally-spun and electrospun RSF nanofibers were spun under the same solution and environment. The morphology, secondary structure, orientation, and thermal properties of the two types of RSF nanofiber aggregation structures were characterized by Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Far Infrared (FIR), Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WXAD), Optical Polarizing Microscopy (OPM), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), respectively. The conformations of the RSF were transformed from random coil to beta-sheet, and at the same time, the crystallinity, orientation, and thermostability were all enhanced through centrifugal spinning. The findings suggest that centrifugal spinning is a more promising approach to fabricate RSF fibers with stable structures and outstanding performances compared with electrospinning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2046-2069;;;;;2015;5;119;;;;;98553;98558;;10.1039/c5ra15486c;;;;;;;WOS:000365403000081;;;;;;

They have to be able to resist to gastric acidity and bile salts in the small intestine. A method for encapsulation and stabilization of probiotic yeast (Saccharomyces boulardii) or bacterial strains (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp.) in polymeric or biopolymeric fibers has been developed. Centrifugal methods using a rotating bell have been employed to produce a mixture of nano- and microfibers. Water solutions of polyvinylalcohol and gelatine with prebiotic fiber inulin and suspended microbial preparations have been used produce the fibers. The centrifugal spinning is simple, cheap and eco-friendly process. The process can be carried out at laboratory temperature without any heating.

Creating porous structures on CNFs yields larger surface area and enhanced capacitive performance. Herein, porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) were synthesized via centrifugal spinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solutions combined with thermal treatment and were used as binder-free EDLC electrodes. Three precursor fibers with PAN/PMMA weight ratios of 9/1, 7/3 and 5/5 were prepared and carbonized at 700, 800, and 900 C, respectively. The highest specific capacitance obtained was 144 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) with a rate capability of 74% from 0.1 to 2 A g(-1) by PCNFs prepared with PAN/PMMA weight ratio of 7/3 at 900 degrees C. These PCNFs also showed stable cycling performance. The present work demonstrates that PCNFs are promising EDLC electrode candidate and centrifugal spinning offers a simple, cost-effective strategy to produce PCNFs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, SiO2/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes were produced by using centrifugal spinning and they were characterized by using different electrochemical techniques for use as separators in Li-ion batteries. SiO2/PAN membranes exhibited good wettability and high ionic conductivity due to their highly porous fibrous structure. Compared with commercial microporous polyolefin membranes, SiO2/PAN membranes had larger liquid electrolyte uptake, higher electrochemical oxidation limit, and lower interfacial resistance with lithium. SiO2/PAN membrane separators were assembled into lithium/lithium iron phosphate cells and these cells delivered high capacities and exhibited good cycling performance at room temperature. In addition, cells using SiO2/PAN membranes showed superior C-rate performance compared to those using microporous PP membrane. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Factors affecting the rheological properties of the sols, such as sol concentrations, aging, and the amounts and types of additives, were investigated by measuring the shear viscosities. The flow characteristics of the sols were studied in relation to the spinnability by measuring the viscosity with respect to the shear rate. The spinnability was obtained through the addition of a polymer which increases the viscosity to a range of optimum viscosity values for spinning. Aging the sols containing the additives did not noticeably change the sol viscosities at room temperature up to 30 days. The flow behavior of the spinnable sols progressively changed from nearly Newtonian to pseudoplastic with an increase in the sol concentration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1229-7801;2234-0491;;;;;2015;52;1;;;;;56;60;;10.4191/kcers.2015.52.1.56;;;;;;;WOS:000435261200010;;;;;;

In the CNTs/CFs obtained by centrifugal spinning, CNTs align along the axis of the CFs, form pi-pi stacking interactions with CFs and strength the electrical conductivity of CFs, which favors the electron collection and transportation. Cross-flake BiOX NSs were uniformly grown on the surface of CNTs/CFs through a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction process. The as-prepared BiOX NSs are less than 20 nm in thickness with dominant reactive (001) facets that are almost fully exposed, promoting the photocatalytic properties. The hierarchical CNTs/CFs-NSs show 3- and 2-fold improved photocatalytic activities for degradation of methyl orange for BiOCl and BiOI compared to corresponding neat NSs, respectively, given the synergistic effects of CNTs/CFs and NSs.

For nozzle-less centrifugal spinning, fingers are formed at the front of thin liquid film due to the theory of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We find that the lower solution concentration and higher rotational speed favor the formation of thinner and longer fingers. Then, the critical angular velocity and initial jet velocity for nozzle-/nozzle-less centrifugal spinning are obtained in accordance with the balance of centrifugal force, viscous force, and surface tension. When jet leaves the spinneret, it will undergo a series of motions including necking and whipping processes, and then, a steady spiral jet path is formed with its radius getting tighter. Finally, we experimentally study the effect of rotational speed and solution concentration on jet path, which shows that the higher rotational speed results in a larger radius of jet path while the solution concentration has little effect on it.

Polycrystalline (Cl/OH)Ap fibres 10-25 mu m in diameter were obtained with 37% ceramic yield by pyrolysis of the green fibres followed by sintering at 1150 degrees C in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis provided evidence for apatite formation starting at 650 degrees C while (Cl/OH)Ap ceramic fibres were obtained at 1100 degrees C via transformation through intermediate dicalcium dichloride hydrogen phosphate (Ca2Cl2(HPO4)) and calcium pyrophosphate (Ca2P2O7) phases. A glass-forming Al-based additive was applied to enhance the mechanical properties of the Cl/OH)Ap ceramic fibres and indeed resulted in the formation of (Cl/OH)Ap/Al2O3 fibres with improved mechanical stability.

Rotary jet spinning (RJS) enables the mass production of nanostructured fibers by centrifugal forces but may result in inconsistent surface morphologies. Because nanofiber performance is dependent upon its surface features, we asked which parameters must be optimized during production to control fiber morphology. We developed and tested a mathematical model that describes how the competition between fluid instability and solvent removal in RJS regulates the degree of beading in fibers. Our data suggest that solvent evaporation during the spinning process causes an increase in jet viscosity and that these changes inhibit both bead formation and jet thinning. The RJS was used to vary experimental parameters, showing that fiber beading can be reduced by increasing solvent volatility, solution viscosity, and spinning velocity. Collectively, our results demonstrate that nanofiber morphology and diameter can be precisely controlled during RJS manufacturing.;;;;Yuan, Hongyan/C-3816-2011- Badrossamay, Mohammad R/B-9710-2012;Yuan, Hongyan/0000-0001-8225-0211- ;;;;;;;;;;;;0743-7463;;;;;NOV 11;2014;30;44;;;;;13369;13374;;10.1021/la5023104;;;;;;;WOS:000344905100029;25353398;;;;;

Chitosan and its composite nanofibers have been fabricated by traditional spinning processes such like wet spinning or electrospinning, but these processes are complex, using harmful solvent or high voltage with lower safety. In search of more simple and safe nanofiber fabrication method applicable to chitosan, six kinds of novel nanofiber fabrication methods are reviewed, these methods are divided into two major categories of small similar to large approach and large similar to small approach. Small similar to large approach includes variety of spinning processes ( such as rotary jet-spinning, handspinning and solution blowing) and two freeze casting processes (simple freeze-drying and jet-rapid freezing), while star burst system as an example of large similar to small approach. Both advantages and disadvantages of each method are compared from the viewpoint of fiber diameter, fiber orientation and the applicability to chitosan. A new innovative idea of combining ultrasonic atomization and freeze casting process for chitosan nanofibers is also provided in this review. Ultrasonic atomization combined with freeze casting method is simple and avoids usage of volatile solvents. Chitosan nanofibers obtained by this innovative method could be applicable to biomedical engineering and food engineering due to both chitosan's characteristics and the safety of fabrication process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1005-281X;;;;;NOV;2014;26;11;;;;;1821;1831;;10.7536/PC140636;;;;;;;WOS:000346224000007;;;;;;

Being a voltage free technique it can overcome the limitations of electrospinning. Owing to the unique characteristic features such as high surface area to volume ratio, porosity, mechanical strength and fiber alignment, centrifugal spun (C-spun) fibrous mat has a wide range of scope in various biomedical applications. Higher degree of fiber alignment can be effortlessly achieved by the C-Spin process. In order to prove the versatility of C-Spin system with respect to fiber alignment, Polycaprolactone (PCL) and gelatin were spun taking them as model polymers. The morphological analysis revealed that highly aligned ultrafine fibers with smooth surface are achieved by C-Spinning. Hydrophilicity, porosity and mechanical property results confirm that the C-spun mat is more suitable for tissue engineering applications. In vitro and in vivo experiments proved that the scaffolds are biocompatible and can be efficiently used as a wound dressing material. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

After that, centrifugal spinning and steam atmosphere heat-treatment were used to obtain final fibers. Here, the molecule structure of precursor was analyzed and the TiO2 fibers obtained were characterized. Additionally, the effects of the silica (SiO2) doping were discussed in this paper. By the Fourier transformation infrared spectrum analysis, the chain structure of -O-Ti-O-Ti-O- was confirmed in the Ti(CH3COO)(4) precursor, as a result the precursor spinning solution showed a good spinning performance. And the pyrolysis process of precursor fibers was analyzed with the help of DSC-TG method. The phase of TiO2 fibers obtained after heat-treatment with steam atmosphere was characterized mainly by the X-ray diffractometer (XRD), from the XRD curves, the result that the SiO2 doping can efficiently inhibit the grain growth of TiO2 fibers could also be verified. The microstructure of the TiO2 fibers was observed by scanning electron microscope, which showed that diameter of TiO2 fibers obtained with excellent continuity are from 5 to 10 mu m.

Three aminosilane coupling agents, namely gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) and N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (AEAPTES), were selected as novel different Si and N dopants. The fibers were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 adsorption-desorption, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The results indicated that Si and N were incorporated into the lattice of TiO2. Si doping enhances surface area, delays the phase transformation from anatase to rutile and improves the UV photocatalytic activity, while N doping improves visible light absorption. In the case of APTES as a modifier at a Si/Ti molar ratio of 0.15, TiO2 fibers with a mixed crystalline phase at an anatase/rutile ratio of 77: 23 and the largest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area were obtained at 900 degrees C. It displayed the highest wide spectral responsive photoactivity, and the degradation rate of the azo dye reactive brilliant red X-3B in aqueous solution reached 96.6% for 90 min and 96.4% for 180 min under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively. In addition, the degradation efficiency was still maintained at >90% for 5 cycles. The resulting wide spectral responsive fibers possess enormous advantages in water treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

A viscoelastic jet has a stretching force in the axial ((a) over right arrow (x)) and tangential ((a) over right arrow (y)) directions under electrostatic and centrifugal forces. The jet radius (R-0) will be dramatically decreased, and the jet velocity (nu(0)) will be substantially increased due to a particular stretching force. The radius of curvature, the jet length, and the Taylor cone of a viscoelastic jet will be completely different when the jet velocity (nu(0)) increases. A strong stretching force and a fast extension speed will form after optimizing the radius of curvature (by Reynolds (Re) and Weber (We) numbers), jet length (by Peclet (Pe) and Epsilon (epsilon) numbers), and Taylor cone (by dimensionless stress (Pi(1)) and Ohnesorge (Oh) numbers). Through dimensionless number and group analysis, higher Re(PC = 9.38 x 10(-2), PLA = 1.52 x 10(-1) and PAN = 1.53 x 10(-2)) and We(PC = 13.8, PLA = 15 and PAN = 13.3) number of all three systems can collect the bead-free and uniform nanofibers. Similarly, higher Pi(1)(PC = 1.83 x 10(-5), PLA = 2.86 x 10(-5) and PAN = 5.13 x 10(-9)) and Oh(PC = 39.60, PLA = 29.22 and PAN = 238.94) numbers refer to viscosity and electrostatic force dominate the jet behavior and obtained the nanofiber with high modulus, hardness, crystallinity and good molecular orientation. Hence, the uniaxially aligned polycarbonate, polylactic acid and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers with superior physical properties (modulus >= 2.77 GPa, 3.3 GPa and 1.46 GPa, hardness >= 0.32, 0.26 and 0.22 and crystallinity >= 3%, 37% and 21%) can be successfully manufactured in this process.

Important cues in this microenvironment are the chemical, mechanical and spatial arrangement of the supporting matrix in the extracellular space. In engineered tissues, synthetic scaffolding provides many of these microenvironmental cues. Key requirements are that synthetic scaffolds should recapitulate the native three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical fibrillar structure, possess biomimetic surface properties and demonstrate mechanical integrity, and in some tissues, anisotropy. Electro-spinning is a popular technique used to fabricate anisotropic nanofiber scaffolds. However, it suffers from relatively low production rates and poor control of fiber alignment without substantial modifications to the fiber collector mechanism. Additionally, many biomaterials are not amenable for fabrication via high-voltage electrospinning methods. Hence, we reasoned that we could utilize rotary jet spinning (RJS) to fabricate highly aligned hybrid protein-polymer with tunable chemical and physical properties. In this study, we engineered highly aligned nanofiber constructs with robust fiber alignment from blends of the proteins collagen and gelatin, and the polymer poly-c-caprolactone via RJS and electrospinning. RJS-spun fibers retain greater protein content on the surface and are also fabricated at a higher production rate compared to those fabricated via electrospinning. We measured increased fiber diameter and viscosity, and decreasing fiber alignment as protein content increased in RJS hybrid fibers. RJS nanofiber constructs also demonstrate highly anisotropic mechanical properties mimicking several biological tissue types. We demonstrate the bio-functionality of RJS scaffold fibers by testing their ability to support cell growth and maturation with a variety of cell types. Our highly anisotropic RJS fibers are therefore able to support cellular alignment, maturation and self-organization. The hybrid nanofiber constructs fabricated by RJS therefore have the potential to be used as scaffold material for a wide variety of biological tissues and organs, as an alternative to electrospinning.

J;Taghavi, SM- Larson, RG;;;;Taghavi, S. M.- Larson, R. G.;;;Regularized thin-fiber model for nanofiber formation by centrifugal spinning;PHYSICAL REVIEW E;;;;;;;;;;;;We propose a regularized thin-fiber (string) model that overcomes past numerical limitations and allows determination of the steady fiber velocity and diameter of a semi-infinite Newtonian viscous fiber emerging from a nozzle rotating about an axis in the presence of centrifugal, inertial, and viscous forces of arbitrary magnitudes. The results are controlled by two dimensionless groups, namely, the Rossby number Rb expressing the ratio of inertial to centrifugal forces and the Reynolds number Re, the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. We find that for Rb < 0.5 and Re < 1, regularization of the string-model equations is required to provide numerical stability, which we achieve. Solutions are thereby obtained in which viscosity reduces curvature in the fiber trajectory- these solutions asymptotically approach the inviscid solution at large distances along the spin line. Thus, long spin lines reach a diameter that is independent of viscosity, as long as the fiber is sufficiently long, a criterion that is made clear in the paper. At Rb > 0.5, regularization is not required, the curvature in fiber trajectory is increased by viscosity, and the solution at large distances along the spin line does not converge to the inviscid result. Regimes of behavior in the plane formed by Re and Rb are mapped out and example behavior is given for each regime.;;;;Taghavi, Seyed Mohammad/L-4700-2016;Taghavi, Seyed Mohammad/0000-0003-2263-0460;;;;;;;;;;;;1539-3755;1550-2376;;;;FEB 14;2014;89;2;;;;;;;23011;10.1103/PhysRevE.89.023011;;;;;;;WOS:000332178600004;25353575;;;;;

M.;;;Influence of nanotube dispersion and spinning conditions on nanofibre nanocomposites of polypropylene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes produced through Forcespinning (TM);JOURNAL OF THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITE MATERIALS;;;;;;;;;;;;Melt centrifugal spinning has been used to successfully produce nanofibres from compounds of polypropylene (PP) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) at a concentration of 1%. The compounds were prepared either via twin screw compounding or by dissolution in decalin with sonication. Nanofibre production was conducted by centrifugal spinning in a Forcespinner, a technology capable of producing nanofibres with a high material throughput. Processing via dissolution resulted in a reduction in the size of the MWNT agglomerations in the polymer, which led to a more uniform fibre morphology and a reduced incidence of bead defects as compared to products produced from the melt extrusion compound. The addition of a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100) to the compound solution aided dispersion of the MWNTs as determined by optical light microscopy of thin cast films and produced fibres with the lowest mean diameter. The mean fibre diameter in the as-spun webs prepared by dissolution of PP in decalin with sonication was found to decrease with increasing spinneret speed- however, a similar trend was not observed for fibres generated from the melt compounded material.;;;;;Rigout, Muriel/0000-0002-4894-7768- Russell, Stephen/0000-0003-0339-9611;;;;;;;;;;;;0892-7057;1530-7980;;;;FEB;2014;27;2;;;;;205;214;;10.1177/0892705713495222;;;;;;;WOS:000329423800005;;;;;;

This work designs a fibrous ZnO catalyst, which was composed of stacked ZnO nanoparticles. Photocatalysis investigations demonstrated that the fibers possess higher catalytic ability compared to their powder counterparts. Moreover, the fibrous form is more suitable for application in a continuous mode and simple separation operation. The ZnO fibers were fabricated by the centrifugal spinning of a molecular precursor sol into gel fibers, followed by heat treatment. The viscous precursor sol was synthesized by concentrating a zinc citrate aqueous solution, which was made from citric acid and ZnO powders. The mechanism of formation of the organozinc sol was investigated by a series of characterizations of the precursor solution, gel precursor, and the decomposition of the gel precursor. The results indicate that zinc citrate monomers in precursor solution were assembled into a multinuclear structure induced by solvent evaporation.;;;;Zhang, Guanghui/ABE-7616-2020;Zhang, Guanghui/0000-0002-8511-1599;;;;;;;;;;;;;2046-2069;;;;;2014;4;101;;;;;57534;57540;;10.1039/c4ra07677j;;;;;;;WOS:000345651600022;;;;;;

J;Zhang, XW- Lu, Y;;;;Zhang, Xiangwu- Lu, Yao;;;Centrifugal Spinning: An Alternative Approach to Fabricate Nanofibers at High Speed and Low Cost;POLYMER REVIEWS;;;;;;;;;;;;Nanofibers are an important class of material that is useful in a variety of applications, including filtration, tissue engineering, protective clothing, battery separators, energy storage, etc. So far, electrospinning is the most used method for producing nanofibers. However, the wide-spread commercial use of electrospinning is limited mainly due to its low production rate. Most other nanofiber production methods, such as melt-blowing, bicomponent fiber spinning, phase separation, template synthesis, and self-assembly, are complex and can only be used to make nanofibers from limited types of polymers. Centrifugal spinning is an alternative method for producing nanofibers from various materials at high speed and low cost. In centrifugal spinning, the spinning fluid is placed in a rotating spinning head. When the rotating speed reaches a critical value, the centrifugal force overcomes the surface tension of the spinning fluid to eject a liquid jet from the nozzle tip of the spinning head. The jet then undergoes a stretching process and is eventually deposited on the collector, forming solidified nanofibers. Centrifugal spinning is simple and enables the rapid fabrication of nanofibers for various applications. This article gives an overview on the centrifugal spinning process, and compares it with conventional nanofiber production methods.;;;;Zhang, Xiangwu/F-1013-2011;Zhang, Xiangwu/0000-0002-6236-6281;;;;;;;;;;;;1558-3724;1558-3716;;;;;2014;54;4;;;;;677;701;;10.1080/15583724.2014.935858;;;;;;;WOS:000341654300004;;;;;;

However, the low production rate and safety concern limit the practical use of electrospinning as a cost-effective nanofiber fabrication approach. Herein, we present a novel and simple centrifugal spinning technology that extrudes nanofibers from polymer solutions by using a high-speed rotary and perforated spinneret. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers were prepared by selectively varying parameters that can affect solution intrinsic properties and operational conditions. The resultant PAN nanofibers were characterized by SEM, and XRD. The correlation between fiber morphology and processing conditions was established. Results demonstrated that the fiber morphology can be easily manipulated by controlling the spinning parameters and the centrifugal spinning process is a facile approach for fabricating polymer nanofibers in a large-scale and low-cost fashion.

The main focus of current studies rely on the range of morphological and dimensional characteristics of fibers that may be expected when using this new technical setup of a rotary-jet based spinning system. In fact, this work represents a proof of concept study regarding the potential of an air flow modified rotary-jet spinning for obtaining continuous fibers and nonwoven mats. The morphological examinations by scanning electron microscopy were proved the efficiency of this technique on obtaining relative homogeneous fiber mats from different raw compositions of pure and admixed, natural and synthetic polymers with different molecular masses and polydispersity degrees, like gelatin, polyurethane, and poly (vinyl chloride). The feasibility of air flow rotary-jet spinning was also tested for simultaneous independent deposition of mixed fiber mats from solutions of two polymers made in different solvents, and it was found that by carefully selecting the ratio of polymers through spinnerets number, this technique could be successfully used even in difficult solvent conditions otherwise incompatible with traditional spinning techniques. The distribution of fiber diameters was varying between nanometer scales (100-700 nm) in the case of pure polyurethane and micrometer ranges (2-12 A mu m) for gelatin-polyurethane mixed mats, which are convenient for various applications, from dressings and scaffolding to different filter systems. Besides the already known advantages of rotary-jet versus electrospinning, the air flow allows the control of solvent evaporation, extending the applicative range of this technique.;;;;Ignat, Leonard/P-3619-2014- Pinteala, Mariana/B-8679-2011;Pinteala, Mariana/0000-0002-4021-982X;;;;;;;;;;;;1229-9197;;;;;SEP;2013;14;9;;;;;1526;1534;;10.1007/s12221-013-1526-0;;;;;;;WOS:000325108400017;;;;;;

The microstructure of the TiO2 fibers was observed by using scanning electron microscope, which showed that the fibers' diameters are in the range of 5-15 mu m. The effects of the SiO2 doping were investigated by using high-resolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffractometer, and the conclusion is that SiO2 doping can efficiently inhibit the grain growth of TiO2 fibers and defer the phase transformation of anatase-to-rutile. In fact, the grain size is 33.2 nm for the un-doped TiO2 fibers heat-treated at 700 A degrees C, while the grain size is only 7.6 nm for the TiO2 fibers doped with 15 wt% SiO2, which shows the possibility to obtain nano-crystalline anatase TiO2 fibers at higher heat-treatment temperature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0928-0707;;;;;MAR;2013;65;3;;;;;443;451;;10.1007/s10971-012-2956-7;;;;;;;WOS:000315628200021;;;;;;

Comparing with conventional electrospinning (10-30 kV) and centrifugal spinning (4,000-12,000 rpm), this technique only requires a lower working voltage (2.8-6.0 kV), a slower rotational speed (360540 rpm), and a shorter spinning distance (2.0-4.0 cm). In addition, the influences of experimental parameters such as working voltage, rotational speed, collecting distance, and solution concentration on the alignment of the as-spun fibers are investigated using image analysis techniques. It is found that the working voltage and rotational speed mainly influence the perpendicular and linear velocities of the fibers, respectively. The polymer fibers tend to show higher alignment degree when these two velocities are very close.

An efficient method of nanofiber production is rotary jet-spinning (RJS), consisting of a perforated reservoir rotating at high speeds along its axis of symmetry, which propels a liquid, polymeric jet out of the reservoir orifice that stretches, dries, and eventually solidifies to form nanoscale fibers. We report a minimal scaling framework complemented by a semi-analytic and numerical approach to characterize the regimes of nanofiber production, leading to a theoretical model for the fiber radius consistent with experimental observations. In addition to providing a mechanism for the formation of nanofibers, our study yields a phase diagram for the design of continuous nanofibers as a function of process parameters with implications for the morphological quality of fibers.

Two current methods of alginate mechanical preparation are a vacuum mixer Vac-U-Vestor, (Whip Mix Corp, Louisville, KY) and a semiautomated method that involves hand spatulation in a rotating bowl Alginator II (Cadco, Oxnard, CA). A new alginate-mixing machine has been introduced, TurboMax (Dentsply Raintree Essex, Sarasota, FL), with a centrifugal-spinning action that reportedly incorporates the alginate powder into the water more efficiently. The purpose of this study was to determine the number, percent, and volume distribution of porosities in alginate mixed with three mechanical-mixing methods using a nondestructive, microtomographic analysis method. Materials and Methods: Alginate was mixed by each of the three mechanical methods per respective manufacturer's guidelines, with the set alginate analyzed using a microtomography unit and proprietary software. A mean and standard deviation was determined per group and analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA/Mann-Whitney tests. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.001) were found between groups per each of the three testing parameters (number, percent, volume distribution of porosities). The vacuum mixer produced significantly less percent porosity and number of porosities than the centrifugal mixer and semiautomated hand mixer. Both the vacuum mixer and centrifugal mixer produced porosities of significantly smaller volume than the semiautomated hand mixer.

The fibers were characterized using XRD, FT-IR, SEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and UV-vis DRS. The addition of silica was a crucial factor for obtaining long fibers because of the formation of Ti-O-Si networks. The effects of dopant contents and heat treatment temperatures were studied. It was found that the proper addition of silica into titania could improve the surface texture and enhance the thermal stability and crystal stability. When Si/Ti molar ratio was 0.15, mesoporous TiO2 fibers with a BET surface area up to 127.7 m(2) g(-1) were obtained after heat treatment at 700 degrees C. It displayed the highest photoactivity of all, and the degradation rate of X-3B in aqueous solution reached 99.6% after 75 min under UV irradiation. Furthermore, the degradation rate and the mineralization rate of X-3B were 94.7% and 58.9% after 3 h under solar irradiation, respectively. In addition, it was worthwhile to mention that the degradation efficiency was also more than 90% after 6 cycles. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J;Foster, LJR- Tighe, BJ;;;;Foster, L. John R.- Tighe, Brian J.;;;In vitro hydrolytic degradation of centrifugally spun polyhydroxybutyrate-pectin composite fibres;POLYMER INTERNATIONAL;;;;;;;;;;;;BACKGROUND: Centrifugal spinning is a novel fibre-forming process that readily permits the incorporation of additives while avoiding the thermal damage often associated with conventional melt spinning. Centrifugal spinning of a viscous solution of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) mixed with pectin was used to fabricate a range of fibres containing different concentrations of this biologically active agent. The influence of this blending on fibre morphology and in vitro degradation in an accelerated hydrolytic model at 70 degrees C and pH of 10.6 is reported. RESULTS: Blending influenced the physiochemical properties of the fibres, and this significantly affected the degradation profile of both the fibre and its PHB constituent. A greater influence on degradation was exerted by the type of pectin and its degree of esterification than by variations in its loading. CONCLUSION: Centrifugal spinning permits the fabrication of composite fibrous matrices from PHB and pectin. Incorporation of the polysaccharide into the fibres can be used to manipulate degradation behaviour and demonstrates a model for doping of matrices with active biological constituents. The unique features of the centrifugal spinning process, as illustrated by the structure of the fibres and the degradation profiles, suggest possible applications of centrifugally spun biopolymers as wound scaffolding devices and in tissue engineering.

The spinnable YAG sol was synthesized using Al powder, Y(CH3COOH)(3)center dot 4H(2)O and HCl as precursors, polyethylene oxide as viscosity adjusting agent. Gel fibers with diameter of 5-10 mu m were prepared from the YAG sol by using centrifugal spinning technique. YAG crystalline fibers were obtained by drying gel fibers and heat-treating at selected temperature. TG/DTA analysis showed an exotherm at 906 degrees C attributed to formation of YAG phase and weight loss of 45% at 1000 degrees C. XRD and FT-IR analysis showed that phase-pure YAG can be formed at 900 degrees C, and no other intermediate was observed. The grain size of YAG fibers increased from 25 to 220 nm and tensile strength decreased rapidly from 970 to 380 MPa when the sintering temperature increased from 900 to 1550 degrees C.

The fiber formation relies upon the Raleigh-Taylor instability of the spin-coated liquid film that arises due to a competition of the centrifugal force and the Laplace force induced by the surface curvature.

Alumina has so high melting point (T-m > 2040 degrees C) that. its mat can be produced through sol-gel method. In this research alumina mat has been manufactured by sol-gel spinning method using our laboratory-designed centrifugal spinneret. The desired viscosity of sol for spinning is 150 P. Phase transformation of the product begins at 600 degrees C and there is not any amorphous phase at 800 degrees C and theta alumina (theta-Al2O3) is the main phase. In this work, transformation of transitional phase to alpha alumina (alpha-Al2O3) takes place from 1000 degrees C to 1200 degrees C. The optimum percent of silica in alumina mat is 4 wt%. Fibers constitute network structure that their average diameter is about 10 mu m and contains very fine grains (100 nm). The silica percent concerning the limits of this study (< 10 wt%) does not effect on fiber diameter, but grain size decreases from about 200 nm to less than 100 nm while increasing silica percent.

Centrifugal spinning of the biopolyester. poly(-3-hvdroxvbutvrate), produced a fibrous matrix described here as wool. The in vitro degradation of this wool was investigated in an accelerated hvdrolytic model at 70degreesC and pH 10.6. Degradation rates were markedly enhanced by the high surface area of the wool and individual degradation profile could be manipulated by varying the purity of the polymer and process conditions. Physical heterogeneity of the wool exered a marked influence upon the degradation process which proceeded through a combination of fibre fragmentation and erosion. Degradation was accompanied by a series of physical changes up to the point of matrix collapse. The unique features of the centrifugal-spinning process, as illustrated by the structure of the fibres and the degradation profiles. suggest possible applications of centrifugally spun biopolymers as wound scaffolding devices.

TiO2 was loaded on the mesoporous silica fiber by simple impregnation method. The Volume of 1 nm pore was decreased by the formation of TiO2 particles in the meso-pores of silica fiber. The TiO2 / mesoporous silica fiber showed the absorption band around 300 - 350 run which has been assigned to the crystalline TiO2 phase.

Hollow fiber membranes were formed after polymerizing the comonomers, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate, in an aqueous system under centrifugal forces. The concentration of methyl methacrylate in the comonomer and the concentration of redox initiators were investigated for their effects on membrane morphology, water content, Young's modulus, and diffusive transport. Both monomer composition and initiator concentration impacted the resulting asymmetric membrane morphology, which varied from a macroporous sponge to a microporous gel to a homogeneous gel. The hollow fiber membranes synthesized herein had equilibrium water contents between 42 and 57%, elastic moduli between 22 and 400 kPa, and effective diffusion coefficients between 10(-7) and 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1) for vitamin B12 and 10 kD dextran. The significant differences in both the moduli and the diffusion coefficients exhibited by these hydrogel membranes reflect differences in their intrinsic microstructures. Synthesis of hydrogel hollow fiber membranes using centrifugal force is a highly dynamic process- the membrane properties can be effectively tailored by controlling phase separation kinetics. These hydrogel hollow fibers are particularly attractive for soft tissue applications, such as nerve guidance channels, where biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and transport properties are determinants of device performance in vivo.;;;;Luo, Ying/A-9920-2012;Luo, Ying/0000-0001-9834-9419;;;;;;;;;;;;0897-4756;1520-5002;;;;NOV;2001;13;11;;;;;4087;4093;;10.1021/cm010323+;;;;;;;WOS:000172323700047;;;;;;

Attempts have been made to obtain the total integrated effect by assessing the force that is required to selectively remove the powder layer from a metal substrate. This is a destructive measurement that disrupts the powder layer. All the measurements are undertaken on the powder layer before fusing. Powder adhesion measurements have been obtained from three different techniques consisting of (i) the centrifugal spinning of a powder coated cylinder, (ii) measuring the mass of powder removed when a powder coated sample is subject to an impulse from a drop test and (iii) selectively removing powder under computer control with a series of micro air pulses. The results tend to be in agreement and from these different test procedures they assist in modelling the structure of a deposited powder layer. Spray tests using different spraying systems indicate that the outer layer of the coating tends to have higher adhesive characteristics when the specific charge (Q*) is < 2 mu C/g. When the specific charge is > 3.5 mu C/g the adhesion of the outer layer is reduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0304-3886;;;;;JUN;1997;40-1;;;;;;253;258;;10.1016/S0304-3886(97)00046-6;;;;;;;WOS:A1997XB34000040;;;;;;

Preparative reverse phase liquid chromatography (LC) was used to isolate and partially purify FB1 and FB2 from the extract. The extract was applied to a C-18 reverse phase cartridge. FB1 and FB2 were eluted from the cartridge by gradient of water-acetonitrile at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. A second preparative LC procedure using 0.5% pyridine-water and two CN cartridges was used to purify FB1. The FB2 fraction was concentrated on a rotary evaporator to remove the acetonitrile. Acetonitrile was added back in sufficient quantity to redissolve the crystalline material in the fraction. An aliquot of the FB2 fraction was added to a centrifugal spinning silicic acid TLC plate. The centrifugal TLC plate was washed at 3 mL/min with a linear gradient of(A) chloroform-acetone(4:3) and (B) methanol-acetone (1:1) to elute the FB2.
